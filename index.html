But he was also the author of superb short tales that were as elegant as they were heartfelt, as grotesque as they were compassionate. Now, on the occasion of what would have been his eightieth birthday, the Modern Library presents the first collection that includes all of Capote&#x2019;s short fiction&#x2013;a volume that confirms his status as one of the masters of this form.<br><br>Among the selections are &#x201c;A Tree of Night,&#x201d; in which an innocent student, sitting on a train beside a slatternly woman and her deaf-mute companion, enters a seductive nightmare that brings back the deepest fears of childhood . . . &#x201c;House of Flowers,&#x201d; the inspiration for a celebrated Broadway musical, which tells of a superstitious prostitute who learns to love in a way no one else can ever understand . . . the holiday perennial &#x201c;A Christmas Memory,&#x201d; famously adapted into a superb made-for-TV movie . . . and &#x201c;The Bargain,&#x201d; Capote&#x2019;s melancholy, never-before-published 1950 story about a suburban housewife&#x2019;s shifting fortunes.<br><br>From the gothic South to the chic East Coast, from rural children to aging urban sophisticates, all the unforgettable places and people of Capote&#x2019;s oeuvre are captured in this first-ever compendium. <i>The Collected Stories of Truman Capote</i> should restore its author to a place above mere celebrity, to the highest levels of American letters.</p><p>TRUMAN CAPOTE was born in New Orleans on September 30, 1924. In 1948 his first novel, <i>Other Voices, Other Rooms,</i> was published to international critical acclaim, assuring Capote a place among the prominent postwar American writers. He won the O. Henry Memorial Short Story Prize twice and was a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. His other works include <i>Breakfast at Tiffany&#x2019;s</i>, <i>The Grass Harp</i>, and the nonfiction masterpiece <i>In Cold Blood</i>. He died on August 25, 1984.<br><br>REYNOLDS PRICE is the James B. Duke Professor of English at Duke University and the distinguished author of more than twenty-five books of fiction, poetry, drama, and essays. He lives in North Carolina.Capote: THE COLLECTED STORIES OF TRUMAN CAPOTE<br><br>The Walls Are Cold<br><br>(1943)<br><br> &#x201c;. . . so Grant just said to them come on along to a wonderful party, and, well it was as easy as that. Really, I think it was just genius to pick them up, God only knows they might resurrect us from the grave.&#x201d; The girl who was talking tapped her cigarette ash on the Persian throw rug and looked apologetically at her hostess.<br><br>The hostess straightened her trim, black dress and pursed her lips nervously. She was very young and small and perfect. Her face was pale and framed with sleek black hair, and her lipstick was a trifle too dark. It was after two and she was tired and wished they would all go, but it was no small task to rid yourself of some thirty people, particularly when the majority were full of her father&#x2019;s scotch. The elevator man had been up twice to complain about the noise; so she gave him a highball, which is all he is after anyway. And now the sailors . . . oh, the hell with it.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, Mildred, really. What are a few sailors more or less? God, I hope they don&#x2019;t break anything. Would you go back in the kitchen and see about ice, please? I&#x2019;ll see what I can do with your new-found friends.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really, darling, I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s at all necessary. From what I understand, they acclimate themselves very easily.&#x201d;<br><br>The hostess went toward her sudden guests. They were knotted together in one corner of the drawing-room, just staring and not looking very much at home.<br><br>The best looking of the sextet turned his cap nervously and said, &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t know it was any kind of party like this, Miss. I mean, you don&#x2019;t want us, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course you&#x2019;re welcome. What on earth would you be doing here if I didn&#x2019;t want you?&#x201d;<br><br>The sailor was embarrassed.<br><br>&#x201c;That girl, that Mildred and her friend just picked us up in some bar or other and we didn&#x2019;t have any idea we was comin&#x2019; to no house like this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How ridiculous, how utterly ridiculous,&#x201d; the hostess said. &#x201c;You are from the South, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>He tucked his cap under his arm and looked more at ease. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m from Mississippi. Don&#x2019;t suppose you&#x2019;ve ever been there, have you, Miss?&#x201d;<br><br>She looked away toward the window and ran her tongue across her lips. She was tired of this, terribly tired of it. &#x201c;Oh, yes,&#x201d; she lied. &#x201c;A beautiful state.&#x201d;<br><br>He grinned. &#x201c;You must be mixed up with some other place, Miss. There sure&#x2019;s not a lot to catch the eye in Mississippi, &#x2019;cept maybe around Natchez way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, Natchez. I went to school with a girl from Natchez. Elizabeth Kimberly, do you know her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, can&#x2019;t say as I do.&#x201d;<br><br>Suddenly she realized that she and the sailor were alone; all of his mates had wandered over to the piano where Les was playing Porter. Mildred was right about the acclimation.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll fix you a drink. They can shift for themselves. My name&#x2019;s Louise, so please don&#x2019;t call me Miss.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My sister&#x2019;s name&#x2019;s Louise, I&#x2019;m Jake.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really, isn&#x2019;t that charming? I mean the coincidence.&#x201d; She smoothed her hair and smiled with her too dark lips.<br><br>They went into the den and she knew the sailor was watching the way her dress swung around her hips. She stooped through the door behind the bar.<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;what will it be? I forgot, we have scotch and rye and rum; how about a nice rum and coke?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you say so,&#x201d; he grinned, sliding his hand along the mirrored bar&#x2019;s surface, &#x201c;you know, I never saw a place like this before. It&#x2019;s something right out of a movie.&#x201d;<br><br>She whirled ice swiftly around in a glass with a swizzle stick. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take you on a forty-cent tour if you like. It&#x2019;s quite large, for an apartment, that is. We have a country house that&#x2019;s much, much bigger.&#x201d;<br><br>That didn&#x2019;t sound right. It was too supercilious. She turned and put the bottle of rum back in its niche. She could see in the mirror that he was staring at her, perhaps through her.<br><br>&#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>She had to think for a minute, really think. She lied so constantly about her age she sometimes forgot the truth herself. What difference did it make whether he knew her real age or not? So she told him.<br><br>&#x201c;Sixteen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And never been kissed . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>She laughed, not at the clich� but her answer.<br><br>&#x201c;Raped, you mean.&#x201d;<br><br>She was facing him and saw that he was shocked and then amused and then something else.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, for God&#x2019;s sake, don&#x2019;t look at me that way, I&#x2019;m not a bad girl.&#x201d; He blushed and she climbed back through the door and took his hand. &#x201c;Come on, I&#x2019;ll show you around.&#x201d;<br><br>She led him down a long corridor intermittently lined with mirrors, and showed him room after room. He admired the soft, pastel rugs and the smooth blend of modernistic with period furniture.<br><br>&#x201c;This is my room,&#x201d; she said, holding the door open for him, &#x201c;you mustn&#x2019;t mind the mess, it isn&#x2019;t all mine, most of the girls have been fixing in here.&#x201d;<br><br>There was nothing for him to mind, the room was in perfect order. The bed, the tables, the lamp were all white but the walls and the rug were a dark, cold green.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, Jake . . . what do you think, suit me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I never saw anything like it, my sister wouldn&#x2019;t believe me if I told her . . . but I don&#x2019;t like the walls, if you&#x2019;ll pardon me for saying so . . . that green . . . they look so cold.&#x201d;<br><br>She looked puzzled and not knowing quite why, she reached out her hand and touched the wall beside her dressing-table.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, the walls I mean, they are cold.&#x201d; She looked up at him and for a moment her face was molded in such an expression he was not quite sure whether she was going to laugh or cry.<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean it that way. Hell, I don&#x2019;t rightly know what I mean!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you, or are we just being euphemistic?&#x201d; It drew a blank so she sat down on the side of her white bed.<br><br>&#x201c;Here,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;sit down and have a cigarette, what ever happened to your drink?&#x201d;<br><br>He sat down beside her. &#x201c;I left it out in the bar. It sure seems quiet back here after all that racket in front.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How long have you been in the navy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Eight months.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Like it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t much concern whether you like it or not. . . . I&#x2019;ve seen a lot of places that I wouldn&#x2019;t otherwise.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why did you enlist then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I was going to be drafted and the navy seemed more to my likin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I tell you, I don&#x2019;t take to this kind of life, I don&#x2019;t like other men bossin&#x2019; me around. Would you?&#x201d;<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t answer but put a cigarette in her mouth instead. He held the match for her and she let her hand brush against his. His hand was trembling and the light was not very steady. She inhaled and said, &#x201c;You want to kiss me, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>She watched him intently and saw the slow, red spread over his face.<br><br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not that kind of girl. I&#x2019;d be scared to kiss a girl like you, &#x2019;sides, you&#x2019;re only making fun out of me.&#x201d;<br><br>She laughed and blew the smoke in a cloud toward the ceiling. &#x201c;Stop it, you sound like something out of a gaslight melodrama. What is &#x2018;that kind of girl,&#x2019; anyway? Just an idea. Whether you kiss me or not isn&#x2019;t of the slightest importance. I could explain, but why bother? You&#x2019;d probably end up thinking I&#x2019;m a nymphomaniac.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know what that is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hell, that&#x2019;s what I mean. You&#x2019;re a man, a real man and I&#x2019;m so sick of these weak, effeminate boys like Les. I just wanted to know what it would be like, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br><br>He bent over her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a funny kid,&#x201d; he said, and she was in his arms. He kissed her and his hand slid down along her shoulder and pressed against her breast.<br><br>She twisted and gave him a violent shove and he went sprawling across the cold, green rug.<br><br>She got up and stood over him and they stared at each other. &#x201c;You dirt,&#x201d; she said. Then she slapped his bewildered face.<br><br>She opened the door, paused, and straightened her dress and went back to the party. He sat on the floor for a moment, then he got up and found his way to the foyer and then remembered that he had left his cap in the white room, but he didn&#x2019;t care, all he wanted was to get out of here.<br><br>The hostess looked inside the drawing-room and motioned for Mildred to come out.<br><br>&#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake, Mildred, get these people out of here; those sailors, what do they think this is . . . the USO?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter, was that guy bothering you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, no, he&#x2019;s just a small town moron who&#x2019;s never seen anything like this before and it&#x2019;s gone to his head in a funny kind of way. It&#x2019;s just one awful bore and I have a headache. Will you get them out for me please . . . everybody?&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded and the hostess turned back down the corridor and went into her mother&#x2019;s room. She lay down on the velvet chaise lounge and stared at the Picasso abstract. She picked up a tiny lace pillow and pushed it against her face as hard as she could. She was going to sleep here tonight, here where the walls were pale rose and warm.</p><h2>Your Secret Self: Illuminating Mysteries of the Twelfth House</h2><p>The Twelfth House is where the angels of our creative inspiration and spirituality, and the demons of our shadow self reside.

It presents a wide range of artworks and styles and groups them by the themes that served as inspiration for the works. People, places, animals and nature. Artists have used these themes as subjects for their art since the beginning of man. Animals and stick people appeared on the walls of caves more than twelve thousand years ago. They remain today as a visual link to our forebears. Celebrations and events are commemorated in paintings, sculpture, and photographs. Fantasy is a powerful stimulus for the creative process. These and other themes in Introducing Art will bring creative inspiration to the classroom.</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>The Banjo: America&#x2019;s African Instrument</h2><p><p>The banjo has been called by many names over its history, but they all refer to the same sound&#x2015;strings humming over skin&#x2015;that has eased souls and electrified crowds for centuries. <i>The Banjo </i>invites us to hear that sound afresh in a biography of one of America&#x2019;s iconic folk instruments. Attuned to a rich heritage spanning continents and cultures, Laurent Dubois traces the banjo from humble origins, revealing how it became one of the great stars of American musical life.</p><p>In the seventeenth century, enslaved people in the Caribbean and North America drew on their memories of varied African musical traditions to construct instruments from carved-out gourds covered with animal skin. Providing a much-needed sense of rootedness, solidarity, and consolation, banjo picking became an essential part of black plantation life. White musicians took up the banjo in the nineteenth century, when it became the foundation of the minstrel show and began to be produced industrially on a large scale.

With a touch of imagination, it can be. Imagination helps us see what&#x2019;s hidden, and it shape-shifts reality&#x2019;s roiling twisting waves. In this inspiring reframe of a classic Buddhist teaching, Zen teacher Norman Fischer writes that the paramitas, or &#x201c;six perfections&#x201d;&#x2014;generosity, ethical conduct, patience, joyful effort, meditation, and understanding&#x2014;can help us reconfigure the world we live in. Ranging from our everyday concerns about relationships, ethics, and consumption to our artistic inspirations and broadest human yearnings, Fischer depicts imaginative spiritual practice as a necessary resource for our troubled times.</p><p>Norman Fischer is a Zen priest, poet, translator, and director of the Everyday Zen Foundation. His numerous books include&nbsp;<i>What Is Zen? Plain Talk for a Beginner&#x2019;s Mind</i>,&nbsp;<i>Training in Compassion: Zen Teachings on the Practice of Lojong</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Opening to You: Zen-Inspired Translations of the Psalms</i>.&#x201c;This book gives me hope. In times like these, when we cannot afford to indulge in hopelessness, Norman Fischer offers us a vision of the human imagination as a spiritual practice and a source of courage and love.

In fact, we might fall into our own hearts along the way.&#x201d;&#x2014;Zenju Earthlyn Manuel, author of <i>The Way of Tenderness: Awakening Through Race, Sexuality, and Gender</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;As an accomplished Zen teacher who is also a poet, Norman Fischer understands the power of the imagination. If reality is not fixed, it must be reimagined over and over, and there is no place to see that more clearly than in the history of great Zen masters.<br> &nbsp;<br> The book shows us the difference between unimaginative religion and the open vision of possibility that authentic religion enables. It teaches us how to develop the imagination&#x2014;a discipline of imagination&#x2014;that shows us how to see the world otherwise.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fischer&#x2019;s discussion of practice is incredibly skillful, honed through decades of personal engagement.&nbsp;We get a glimpse of the difference between imaginative religious practice and practice that ironically is stultifying.&nbsp;Working through the Buddhist six perfections, he asks not just what each paramita is, but how it can be imagined today and how we might begin to practice it creatively.&nbsp;Every section in the book concludes with practices providing examples of what we might do with these Buddhist teachings in our own time and place.<br> &nbsp;<br> A unique contribution to a vital dimension of Buddhism, written by someone who has long practiced what he is teaching. Highly recommended.&#x201d;&#x2014;Dale S. Wright, author of <i>The Six Perfections: Buddhism and the Cultivation of Character</i> and<i> What Is Buddhist Enlightenment?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We need to be reminded again and again to stay in touch with our own interior world, where a deeper meaning of life can be found. This book with its fresh approach to the six paramitas is here to do that very job. It gently yet powerfully reminds us to not get lost in the trap of self-centeredness and materialism, but to nourish our spiritual impulse which wants to expand our heart. I&#x2019;m deeply thankful to Norman for writing this with such deep insight and love.&#x201d;&#x2014;Anam Thubten, author of <i>Embracing Each Moment </i>and <i>The Magic of Awareness</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Buddhists are often skeptical of the word <i>imagination</i>, interpreting it to mean a flight into fantasy. But Norman Fischer, in his new book, <i>The World Could Be Otherwise</i>, makes it clear that imagination is the raw potential, the very source of inspiration, creativity, and astonishment that lies at the heart of a fully integrated spiritual life. He leads us with precision and skill through the Six Perfections (paramitas), using imagination as the uplifting force that binds the heart&#x2019;s calling for perfection to our human frailties. And he couples these inspiring teachings with grounded daily-life practices. This book is a source of renewal for anyone willing to move beyond their complacency and routine to ponder the wondrous possibilities that abound.&#x201d;&#x2014;Rodney Smith, author of <i>Touching the Infinite: A New Perspective on the Buddha&#x2019;s Four Foundation of Mindfulness</i></p><h2>Deutsch: Na klar!

Lathi emphasizes the physical appreciation of concepts rather than the mere mathematical manipulation of symbols. Avoiding the tendency to treat engineering as a branch of applied mathematics, he uses mathematics to enhance physical and intuitive understanding of concepts, instead of employing it only to prove axiomatic theory. Theoretical results are supported by carefully chosen examples and analogies, allowing students to intuitively discover meaning for themselves.<br></p><p>Also by the same author: <p><i>Linear Systems and Signals,</i> ISBN: 0-941413-34-9, Berkeley-Cambridge Press (916/ 485-5019; fax: 916/485-3019; e-mail: bercamb@yahoo.com) </p><p>and </p><p><i>Modern Digital and Analog Communication Systems</i> (3rd ed.), Oxford University Press</p><br>B.P.

Many deal with this by telling children that the legends surrounding Santa Claus are based on a real, historical figure named Nicholas, a Christian bishop known for his generosity.</p> <p>This picture book presents a shortened, somewhat fictionalized version of the life of Saint Nicholas, explaining that Nicholas was a servant of God and that, through him, God's love was reflected to others. The story touches on the ministry of Nicholas and his generous gift of a dowry to three young girls as a response to God's love in Jesus. And it brings application to our own lives as we, too, respond with grateful hearts to God's great gift of love to us.</p> <p>Combining museum-quality artwork and family-friendly language, this book clearly articulates how God showered His love upon us through Christ and helps children see that our own gift-giving is a grateful response to the sacrificial gift of God's Son.</p></p><p>Chris Ellison&#39;s children&#39;s book, King of the Stable, was awarded the Gold Medallion from the Evangelical Christian Publishers Assocaition in 1999.

On the eve of the ceremony, the <i>New York Times</i> published an editorial by Arthur Mizener questioning the wisdom of the Swedish Academy&#x2019;s decision: &#x201c;Does a Moral Vision of the Thirties Deserve a Nobel Prize?&#x201d; The article seared Steinbeck&#x2019;s soul, no doubt, and placed once again before his American readers the enigma of his reputation. How to define this most American of writers, the engaged artist of 1930s California? And how to describe this last novel, certainly not a howl of social protest in the vein of his 1939 classic, <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>, but neither the twilight reflections of an aging writer. For many readers <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i> is a dark morality tale about the fall of a blue-blooded American hero, Ethan Allen Hawley, who succumbs to the temptations of wealth, power, and prestige. But this final novel defies categories. If it&#x2019;s a parable of corruption and redemption, as Steinbeck suggests in his epigraph, it&#x2019;s also a lesson in Darwinian survival. The novel insists on a symbolic and highly ironic framework&#x2014;the first half takes place on Easter weekend in April 1960 and the second on the Fourth of July weekend that same year. Yet the book is also realistic, set in Steinbeck&#x2019;s own Sag Harbor, New York&#x2014;New Baytown in the novel&#x2014;and influenced by the moral quagmires of contemporary America. And while the work tips its hat to Steinbeck&#x2019;s love of the Arthurian saga, with Ethan a latter-day Lancelot, it&#x2019;s also true that Ethan&#x2019;s voice seems almost postmodern, speaking a language that is highly wrought, artificial, self-reflective. <i>The Winterof Our Discontent</i> is, seemingly, a patchwork of intentions, all meant to shake a reader&#x2019;s complacency.</p><p>Since its publication in April 1961, this &#x201c;curious&#x201d; novel has baffled many readers. Carlos Baker&#x2019;s review for the <i>New York Times</i> sounds a characteristic note of dissatisfaction:</p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p>This is a problem novel whose central problem is never fully solved, an internal conflict novel in which the central issue between nobility and expediency, while it is joined, is never satisfactorily resolved. For this reason, despite its obvious powers, <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i> cannot rightly stand in the forefront of Steinbeck&#x2019;s fiction.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p>Far from being the source of the novel&#x2019;s creative failure, its irresolution and allusiveness are, in fact, central to its meaning. &#x201c;If this is a time of confusion,&#x201d; Steinbeck had written a few years earlier, &#x201c;might it be best to set that down?&#x201d; That was his challenge in <i>The Winter of Our Discontent.</i> Ambiguous threads and ethical knots are woven into each page of the narrative&#x2014;and apparent in the first pages, starting with the perplexities of Ethan&#x2019;s ancestral heritage, part pirate, part Puritan, and his own name, Ethan Allen, both a Revolutionary War patriot and a man charged with treason. After two chapters in each section of the novel&#x2019;s two sections, point of view switches from third to first person.<p></p><p>Indeed, the text&#x2019;s evasive strategies and perplexing characters suggest Steinbeck&#x2019;s profound unease with Cold War America, where his real fear for his country centered not on Sputnik and Russian armament but on &#x201c;a creeping, all-pervading, nerve-gas of immorality which starts in the nursery and does not stop before it reaches the highest offices, both corporate and governmental.&#x201d; Steinbeck sent that observation to his close friend, politician Adlai Stevenson, in November 1959, and the letter was subsequently published in <i>Newsday,</i> sparking a national discussion: The question &#x201c;Are We Morally Flabby?&#x201d; was debated by four educators and writers in a February 1960 issue of the <i>New Republic,</i> and the next month <i>Newsday</i> published &#x201c;Steinbeck Replies.&#x201d; Steinbeck&#x2019;s answer was a resounding yes, and more than anything else <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i> explores the contours of that affirmative response. From 1960, when he composed this novel, to the end of his life eight years later, Steinbeck stood as America&#x2019;s moral compass, pointing to Americans&#x2019; virtues and lapses in three unflinching books: <i>The Winter of Our Discontent, Travels with Charley</i> (1962), and <i>America and Americans</i> (1966).</p><p>The freedom to critique one&#x2019;s country, he felt with increasing urgency, was the role of the artist in a free nation. Trips to the Soviet Union in 1937, 1947, and 1963 as well as charges made by Communist writers that he had moved politically to the right crystallized his independent stance&#x2014;Steinbeck&#x2019;s Cold War was a &#x201c;Duel Without Pistols&#x201d; (a 1952 article he wrote in Italy after being attacked in a Communist newspaper for not objecting to the &#x201c;degeneracy and brutality of American soldiers&#x201d; in Korea). While American citizens and artists could voice opinions freely, he wrote, Communist artists were constrained by orthodoxy. Speak as an American critic he would, to the end of his days. That defiant patriotism informs <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i>. In effect, Ethan Allen Hawley, his central character, asserts his own freedom to speak out and, in the process, replaces a hollow self with a more authentic self, however morally imperiled. What makes it such a quirky and important book is that it suggests, through Ethan&#x2019;s voice, the simmering discontent of its time, the cacophony and dislocation of Cold War America, overtly a superpower, internally super powerless.</p><p>I. UNDERSTANDING JOHN <b>STEINBECK&#x2019;S DISCONTENT</b> </p><p><i>&#x201c;A novel may be said to be the man who writes it.&#x201d;</i> <br>( John Steinbeck to Elizabeth Otis and Chase Horton, April 1957)</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p>With a particular man in mind, Thomas Malory, John Steinbeck wrote this in 1957, one year into his three-year investigation of this fifteenth-century author of <i>Le Morte d&#x2019;Arthur,</i> his era, Arthur&#x2019;s Camelot, and Middle English manuscripts. Such layered understanding was essential, he thought, before attempting his own translation of Malory&#x2019;s <i>Arthur</i> into modern English. But the same sentence might be written about Steinbeck himself: <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i> is the restless man who wrote it. A decade-long winter of discontent is, in several senses, his own. And the project he put aside in the fall of 1959, his modern translation of Malory, informs the background of his final novel.<p></p><p>Steinbeck&#x2019;s discontent, however, was artistic and cultural, not personal. The year 1950 was a watershed; he moved permanently from California, his birthplace, to New York City in December 1949, and a year later he married his third wife, Elaine Scott. This marriage gave him far more stability than the first two&#x2014;certainty of love shared with a self-confident woman. Once an assistant stage manager on Broadway (for <i>Oklahoma!</i> when it opened), Elaine stepped into her new marriage with style, energy, wit, and steady love. For their eighteen years of marriage, she kept much of the world at bay. Some qualities of Steinbeck&#x2019;s happy marriage to Elaine make their way into <i>The Winter of Our Discontent</i>&#x2014;certainly the solidity of the union (this is, in fact, the only Steinbeck book that opens with a bedroom scene). Ethan&#x2019;s rather cloying nicknames for Mary are close to Steinbeck&#x2019;s own for his beloved Elaine, who was &#x201c;<i>moglie</i>&#x201d; when they traveled and &#x201c;Lily Maid&#x201d; at home. Most important, the steady light that Mary casts for Ethan is Elaine&#x2019;s for John: &#x201c;No one in the world can rise to a party or a plateau of celebration like my Mary,&#x201d; Ethan muses. &#x201c;With Mary in the doorway of a party everyone feels more attractive and clever than he was, and so he actually becomes.&#x201d; The marriage of Ethan and Mary is Steinbeck&#x2019;s most fully drawn portrait of marriage and home life&#x2014;at least in part an index of his own contentment.</p><p>With an equal sense of renewal, this displaced Californian embraced his and Elaine&#x2019;s new home, New York City, and made it his own: &#x201c;As far as homes go,&#x201d; he wrote in a 1953 essay, &#x201c;Autobiography: Making of a New Yorker,&#x201d; &#x201c;there is only a small California town and New York. . . . All of everything is concentrated here, population, theater, art, writing, publishing, importing, business, murder, mugging, luxury, poverty. It is all of everything. It goes all night. It is tireless and its air is charged with energy.

Speaking in English and extemporaneously, Derrida takes up with unusual clarity and great eloquence such topics as the task of philosophy, the Greeks, justice, responsibility, the gift, the community, the distinction between the messianic and the concrete messianisms, and his interpretation of James Joyce. Derrida convincingly refutes the charges of relativism and nihilism that are often leveled at deconstruction by its critics and sets forth the profoundly affirmative and ethico-political thrust of his work. The &#x201c;Roundtable&#x201d; is marked by the unusual clarity of Derrida&#x2019;s presentation and by the deep respect for the great works of the philosophical and literary tradition with which he characterizes his philosophical work. </p><p>The Roundtable is annotated by John D. Caputo, the David R. Cook Professor of Philosophy at Villanova University, who has supplied cross references to Derrida&#x2019;s writings where the reader may find further discussion on these topics. Professor Caputo has also supplied a commentary which elaborates the principal issues raised in the Roundtable. </p><p>In all, this volume represents one of the most lucid, compact and reliable introductions to Derrida and deconstruction available in any language. An ideal volume for students approaching Derrida for the first time, Deconstruction in a Nutshell will prove instructive and illuminating as well for those already familiar with Derrida&#x2019;s work.</p></p><p>Responding to questions put to him at a Roundtable held at Villanova University in 1994, Jacques Derrida leads the reader through an illuminating discussion of the central themes of deconstruction.John D.

This Norton Critical Edition presents Paine and his writing within the transatlantic and global context of the revolutionary ideas and actions of his time.</strong></p> Thomas Paine&#x2019;s loyalties were with universal and self-evident principles rather than with a particular group or nation, and it is this dimension that informed his most important works. This Norton Critical Edition shows how Paine&#x2019;s fury at the British Empire, including its injustices to South Asians and Africans, shaped his first best seller, <em>Common Sense</em>, and how his direct involvement with the French Revolution pushed his ideas toward a unique form of democratic radicalism. Together with his rejection of organized religion, Paine&#x2019;s radicalism resulted in his being one of the most hated men in both monarchial Britain and republican America.<br><br> This volume includes J. M. Opal&#x2019;s introduction, &#x201c;Thomas Paine and the Revolutionary Enlightenment, 1770s&#x2013;90s,&#x201d; which provides essential biographical and historical details across three tumultuous decades. Paine&#x2019;s most important works&#x2015;from <em>Common Sense</em> (1776) through <em>Agrarian Justice</em> (1796)&#x2015;are reprinted and are accompanied by explanatory annotations.<br><br> Supporting materials include a wide range of documents from the turbulent years following the publication of both <em>Common Sense</em> and the Declaration of Independence. These include Pennsylvania&#x2019;s gradual emancipation statute of the 1780s, an ex-slave&#x2019;s impassioned call for revolutionary violence against European imperialists and masters, and a British conservative&#x2019;s witty rejoinder to Paine&#x2019;s vision of a brave new world.<br><br> Four major interpretations of Paine&#x2019;s work are provided by Nathan R. Perl-Rosenthal, Robert A. Ferguson, Gary Kates, and Gregory Claeys.<br><br> A Selected Bibliography is also included.</p><p>Includes the complete texts of "Common Sense; Rights of Man, Part the Second; The Age of Reason (part one); "Four Letters on Interesting Subjects, published anonymously and just discovered to be Paine's work; and "Letter to the Abbe Raynal, Paine's first examination of world events; as well as selections from "The American Crises <br>In 1776, America was a hotbed of enlightenment and revolution. Thomas Paine not only spurred his fellow Americans to action but soon came to symbolize the spirit of the Revolution. His elegantly persuasive pieces spoke to the hearts and minds of those fighting for freedom.

He holds that ours is but one of a plurality of possible worlds; and that we who inhabit this world are but a few out of all the inhabitants of all the worlds. Lewis argues that the utility of modal realism is reason to believe that it is true.</p><p>This book is a defense of modal realism; the thesis that our world is but one of a plurality of worlds, and that the individuals that inhabit our world are only a few out of all the inhabitants of all the worlds. Lewis argues that the philosophical utility of modal realism is a good reason for believing that it is true. <p>After putting forward the type of modal realism he favors, Lewis answers numerous objections that have been raised against it. These include an insistence that everything must be actual; paradoxes akin to those that confront naive set theory; arguments that modal realism leads to inductive skepticism, or to disregard for prudence and morality; and finally, sheer incredulity at a theory that disagrees so badly with common opinion. Lewis grants the weight of the last objection, but takes it to be outweighed by the benefits to systematic theory that acceptance of modal realism brings. He asks whether these same benefits might be gained more cheaply if we replace his many worlds by many merely 'abstract' representations; but concludes that all versions of this 'ersatz modal realism' are in serious trouble. In the final chapter, Lewis distinguishes various questions about trans-world identity, and argues that his 'method of counterparts' is preferable to alternative approaches.</p><b>David Lewis</b> (1941- 2001) was Professor of Philosophy at Princeton University.

Now, in an era characterized by levels of school segregation the country has not seen since the mid-twentieth century, cultural critic and American studies professor Noliwe Rooks provides a trenchant analysis of our separate and unequal schools and argues that profiting from our nation&#x2019;s failure to provide a high-quality education to all children has become a very big business.<br><br><em>Cutting School</em> deftly traces the financing of segregated education in America, from reconstruction through <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> up to the current controversies around school choice, teacher quality, the school-to-prison pipeline, and more, to elucidate the course we are on today: the wholesale privatization of our schools. Rooks&#x2019;s incisive critique breaks down the fraught landscape of &#x201c;segrenomics,&#x201d; showing how experimental solutions to the so-called achievement gaps&#x2014;including charters, vouchers, and cyber schools&#x2014;rely on, profit from, and ultimately exacerbate disturbingly high levels of racial and economic segregation under the guise of providing equal opportunity.<br><br>Rooks chronicles the making and unmaking of public education and the disastrous impact of funneling public dollars to private for-profit and nonprofit operations.

But since then partisanship, the dramatic movement of Republicans to the right, and political brinksmanship have led to legislative gridlock on environmental issues. In this book, Christopher Klyza and David Sousa argue that the longstanding legislative stalemate at the national level has forced environmental policymaking onto other pathways.</p><p>Klyza and Sousa identify and analyze five alternative policy paths, which they illustrate with case studies from 1990 to the present: &#x201c;appropriations politics&#x201d; in Congress; executive authority; the role of the courts; &#x201c;next-generation&#x201d; collaborative experiments; and policymaking at the state and local levels. This updated edition features a new chapter discussing environmental policy developments from 2006 to 2012, including intensifying partisanship on the environment, the failure of Congress to pass climate legislation, the ramifications of Massachusetts v. EPA, and other Obama administration executive actions (some of which have reversed Bush administration executive actions). Yet, they argue, despite legislative gridlock, the legacy of 1960s and 1970s policies has created an enduring &#x201c;green state&#x201d; rooted in statutes, bureaucratic routines, and public expectations. </p></p><p>Christopher McGrory Klyza is Robert &#39;35 and Helen &#39;38 Stafford Professor of Public Policy and Professor of Political Science and Environmental Studies at Middlebury College.<p>This work is significant because it provides a much-needed corrective to a great deal of environmental policy scholarship and journalism that far overstates the demise of American environmental regulation, management, and policy since the Reagan administration. With rich, engaging, and informative writing, Klyza and Sousa have created first-rate scholarship that is persuasive without being polemical. Moreover, American history since publication of the first edition strongly corroborates their analysis. Over the last decade, unprecedented partisanship and legislative gridlock ensured that alternative pathways to environmental policy continued their 'green drift' and may do so for years to come.</p>&#x2015;<b>Daniel Press</b>, Olga T.

Dickens's story of solitary miser Ebenezer Scrooge, who is taught the true meaning of Christmas by the three ghosts of Christmas past, present and future, has been adapted into countless film and stage versions since it was first published. Dickens's other Christmas writings collected here include 'The Story of the Goblins who Stole a Sexton', the short story from <i>The Pickwick Papers</i> on which A Christmas Carol was based; <i>The Haunted Man</i>, a tale of a man tormented by painful memories; along with shorter pieces, some drawn from the 'Christmas Stories' that Dickens wrote annually for his weekly journals. In all of them Dickens celebrates the season as one of geniality, charity and remembrance. This new selection contains an introduction by distinguished Dickens scholar Michael Slater discussing how the author has shaped ideas about the Christmas spirit, original illustrations by 'Phiz' and John Leech, an appendix on Dickens's use of <i>The Arabian Nights</i>, a further reading list and explanatory notes.&nbsp;<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700&nbsp;titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>In the history of English literature, Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, which has been continuously in print since it was first published in the winter of 1843, stands out as the quintessential Christmas story. What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>To Know as We Are Known: Education as a Spiritual Journey</h2><p><p>This primer on authentic education explores how mind and heart can work together in the learning process. Moving beyond the bankruptcy of our current model of education, Parker Palmer finds the soul of education through a lifelong cultivation of the wisdom each of us possesses and can share to benefit others. </p></p><p>A spirituality of education that challenges teachers to move beyond conventional ideas of instruction and learning to develop vital new teaching methods incorporating insights from traditional contemplative wisdom.<p>Parker J.

They are the very simplest things, and because it takes a man's life to know them the little new that each man gets from life is very costly and the only heritage he has to leave." <br> -- ERNEST HEMINGWAY <br> <br> In the winter of 1933, Ernest Hemingway and his wife Pauline set out on a two-month safari in the big-game country of East Africa, camping out on the great Serengeti Plain at the foot of magnificent Mount Kilimanjaro. "I had quite a trip," the author told his friend Philip Percival, with characteristic understatement. <br> <i>Green Hills of Africa</i> is Hemingway's account of that expedition, of what it taught him about Africa and himself. Richly evocative of the region's natural beauty, tremendously alive to its character, culture, and customs, and pregnant with a hard-won wisdom gained from the extraordinary situations it describes, it is widely held to be one of the twentieth century's classic travelogues.</p><p>6 1.5-hour cassettesErnest Hemingway did more to influence the style of English prose than any other writer of his time. Publication of&nbsp;<i>The Sun Also Rises</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>A Farewell to Arms</i>&nbsp;immediately established him as one of the greatest literary lights of the 20th century. His classic novella&nbsp;<i>The Old Man and the Sea&nbsp;</i>won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He died in 1961.</p><h2>Daniel Boone: The Life and Legend of an American Pioneer</h2><p>Boone scouted the trans-Appalachian West for settlement, surveyed and helped build the Wilderness Road, and led the settlers&#39; struggle against the Shawnee defenders of Kentucky. Drawing from popular narrative, public record, documentation from Boone&#39;s own hand, and recollection gathered by 19th-century antiquarians, the author employs the methods of the new social history to produce a portrait that defines Daniel Boone and the times he helped shape. Includes 16 pages of black and white illustrations. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>The legend of the American frontier is largely the legend of a single individual, Daniel Boone, who looms over our folklore like a giant. Boone figures in other traditions as well: Goethe held him up as the model of Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#39;s &#34;natural man,&#34; and Lord Byron devoted several stanzas of his epic poem Don Juan to the frontiersman, calling Boone &#34;happiest of mortals any where.&#34; But folklore is not history, and we are fortunate to have a reliable and factual life of Boone through the considerable efforts of John Mack Faragher. The contradictory admirer of Indians who participated in their destruction, the slaveholder who cherished liberty, the devoted family man who prized solitude and would disappear into the woods for years at a time--the real Boone is far more interesting than the mythical image, and in this book we finally catch sight of him.<b>John Mack Faragher</b> is the Arthur Unobskey Professor of American History at Yale University. He is the author of <i>Women and Men on the Overland Trail</i>, for which he received the Frederick Jackson Turner Award, and the acclaimed <i>Sugar Creek: Life on the Illinois Prairie</i>.</p><h2>The Hog&#39;s Back Mystery (British Library Crime Classics)</h2><p><p><strong>Mystery crime fiction written in the Golden Age of Murder</strong></p><p>'As pretty a piece of work as Inspector French has done...

This book had good points and bad points for me. It was told from the perspective of the Scotland Yard inspector working the case. There was very minimal action it was definitely written to be a brain buster to see if you could work out what had happened BEFORE the last two chapters of the book where they spell it all out for you. It was definitely a book to take you back to a much, much simpler time which I appreciated. I would have to say that the best aspect of this book was the complete lack of forensic options due to the time period, I loved the fact that it was all brain power on the part of the inspector.</p> (<i><b>Netgalley</b></i>)<br><br><p>A delightful British Crime Book.

Different and seemingly contradictory movements were evolving, and the dominant style that emerged during this period was Impressionism. Based in part on the broken brushwork and high-keyed palette of Claude Monet, it was a form especially suited to the dramatic landscape and shimmering light of California. American Impressionism grew in popularity as artists from across the nation migrated to the Golden State. There they created a remarkable style, often referred to as California <i>plein-air</i> painting, combining several aspects of American and European art and capturing the brilliant mix of color and light that defined California.<br><br>This book celebrates forty Impressionist painters who worked in California from 1900 through the beginning of the Great Depression. A joint effort of The Irvine Museum and the Georgia Museum of Art, it includes widely recognized California artists such as Maurice Braun and Guy Rose, less well known artists such as Mary DeNeale Morgan and Donna Schuster, and eastern painters who worked briefly in the region, such as Childe Hassam and William Merritt Chase.<br><br>The contributors' essays examine the socioeconomic forces that shaped this art movement, as well as the ways in which the art reflected California's self-cultivated image as a healthful, sun-splashed arcadia.

Twenty writers contributed tales, including Tanith Lee, Gregory Maguire, Patricia A. McKillip, and Ellen Steiber. Delia Sherman's "CATNYP" concerns a feisty changling girl who helps a changling boy return to the "real" New York City from the parallel fairy world where they were both raised. In the story, the New York Public Library's automated catalog called CATNYP is a real lion and a library page is literally an animated piece of paper that retrieves books. In Bruce Glassco's "Never Never," Captain Hook and his pirate gang find themselves repeatedly resurrected for the amusement of their eternal foe, Peter Pan. Gregory Frost's scary Japanese tale, "Tengu Mountain," is about an evil goblin that disguises itself as a priest or monk to attack and kill unsuspecting travelers.

For over fifty years, American schools have operated on the assumption that challenging children is bad for them, teachers do not need to know the subjects they teach, that the learning "process" should be emphasised over the facts taught within it. Yet, as renowned educator and author E. D. Hirsch shows in <i>The Schools We Need</i>, this establishment ideology is a tragedy of good intentions gone awry. Hirsch argues that in eschewing content-based curricula for abstract--and disproved--theories of congnitive development, the educational establishment has done irreparable harm to America's students, and instead of preparing them for the country's highly competitive, information-based economy, the process-oriented curricula the establishment practices has severely curtailed their ability, and desire, to learn.<br>Suggesting a curriculum based on hard work, knowledge aquisition, and rigorous testing that has been proven successful time after time, <i>The Schools We Need</i> offers a proficient and workable solution. By providing evidence of numerous studies proving that fact-based education works, and a glossary of brief, authoritative explanations of educational phrases often used to dazzle teachers and the general public, Hirsch proves that if children are taught substantial knowledge and skills, and learn to work hard to acquire them, their test scores will rise, their love of learning will grow, and they will become enthusiastic participants in the information-age civilization.<br><i>The Schools We Need</i> is a passionate and thoughtful book that will appeal to the millions of people who can't understand why American schools just don't work.</p><p>Everyone wonders why American schools have gone bad. E.D. Hirsch, author of Cultural Literacy, offers a compelling explanation. Schools do a lousy job of transmitting &#34;core knowledge&#34; to their students, he says. To improve, they must abandon all of their feel-good theories about &#34;critical thinking&#34; and work harder to endow kids with intellectual capital at an early age. It may sound like common sense, but this important book shows why so many educators appear to have lost theirs."Offers a penetrating and compelling analysis of how, despite the good intentions of educators, bad ideas and failed theories now characterize American education."<br>--<i>The Indianapolis Star</i><br><br>"A brilliant, combative, and intensely practical discussion of how our education system got into its current mess and what we must do to pull it out."<br>--Donna Fowler, American Federation of Teachers<br><br>"A damning, highly provocative, full-scale assault on today's educational establishment."<br>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>The Witchcraft Sourcebook</h2><p><p>This fascinating collection of documents illustrates the development of ideas about witchcraft from ancient times to the twentieth century.

Defenders claim that FDR saved millions of potential victims by defeating Nazi Germany. Others revile him as morally indifferent and indict him for keeping America's gates closed to Jewish refugees and failing to bomb Auschwitz's gas chambers.</p><p><br></p><p><br>In an extensive examination of this impassioned debate, Richard Breitman and Allan J. Lichtman find that the president was neither savior nor bystander. In <i>FDR and the Jews</i>, they draw upon many new primary sources to offer an intriguing portrait of a consummate politician-compassionate but also pragmatic-struggling with opposing priorities under perilous conditions. For most of his presidency Roosevelt indeed did little to aid the imperiled Jews of Europe. He put domestic policy priorities ahead of helping Jews and deferred to others' fears of an anti-Semitic backlash. Yet he also acted decisively at times to rescue Jews, often withstanding contrary pressures from his advisers and the American public. Even Jewish citizens who petitioned the president could not agree on how best to aid their co-religionists abroad.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Though his actions may seem inadequate in retrospect, the authors bring to light a concerned leader whose efforts on behalf of Jews were far greater than those of any other world figure. His moral position was tempered by the political realities of depression and war, a conflict all too familiar to American politicians in the twenty-first century.</p></p><p>Richard Breitman is Distinguished Professor in the Department of History at American University.<br><br>Allan J. Lichtman is Distinguished Professor in the Department of History at American University.Sadly, Roosevelt left behind a rather thin paper trail. He didn't write a memoir or record many White House conversations, and he refused to allow note-taking at his personal meetings. To fill this gap, <b>Breitman</b> and <b>Lichtman</b> have combed the archives of the leading players who <i>did </i>write down their thoughts and recollections, and the result is quite impressive. Even those who disagree with the book's conclusions must acknowledge the mountain of research on which they rest...The authors rightly note the squeamishness of America's modern presidents in dealing with genocide...Historically speaking, Roosevelt comes off rather well...[An] eminently sensible book. (David Oshinsky <i>New York Times Book Review</i> 2013-04-07)<br><br>While this incisively written study is unlikely to sway anyone whose mind is already made up, readers without fixed views will find plenty to ponder. And it will remind everyone not only of the enormity of the Holocaust but...the ultimate limitations of the presidency, no matter who holds the office. (Alan Cate <i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> 2013-04-01)<br><br><b>Breitman</b> and <b>Lichtman</b> pursue several telling currents in FDR's record, namely the president's ability to keep the private separate from the public, his reliance on Jewish leaders and his evolving enlightenment toward Jewish issues as he neared the end of his life. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> 2013-02-01)<br><br>This splendid book should banish forever the notion that Franklin Roosevelt was a blinkered anti-Semite who made little effort to stop the Holocaust. With dazzling research and astute judgments, <b>Richard Breitman</b> and <b>Allan Lichtman</b> portray FDR as a cunning politician who, in the dreadful context of his times, did more to aid Jews than any other leader in the United States or abroad. (Michael Kazin, author of <i>American Dreamers: How the Left Changed a Nation</i>)<br><br>The FDR who emerges here is concerned with the fate of European Jewry, but also exquisitely sensitive to the demands of the situation: in short, he is the ultimately political man, and his approach shifts with each turn of major events.

(Jerome Donnelly <i>America</i> 2013-05-06)<br><br>Thoughtful and persuasive...It poses a challenge to the theme that American Jews have no friends, that the gentile world has been at best indifferent to the survival of the Jewish people. It shows that, while there were some anti-Semites in the State Department, the best friend Jews had anywhere in the world in the 1940s was the government of the United States and its president FDR; that, while FDR put domestic political factors ahead of rescuing European Jews, he did far more than any other head of government to act to protect Jews facing death...It's the most responsible, reasoned, well-documented assessment of FDR's role. (Jon Wiener <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i> 2013-05-12)<br><br>At long last, two historians have sought to provide an analysis of Roosevelt's stance on the 'Jewish question' that avoids the tempting urge to judge the past through the lenses of the present...<i>FDR and the Jews</i> offers...a new perspective, a cogent and comprehensive study of Roosevelt's evolving opinions on the Jews...<b>Breitman</b> and <b>Lichtman</b>'s carefully documented explication of this somewhat byzantine narrative proves immensely valuable in understanding the mechanics of what remain some of the most controversial decisions in the history of American foreign policy: the refusal to admit the Jewish refugees aboard the SS St. Louis to the United States in 1939 and the refusal to bomb the Auschwitz crematoria after their existence was discovered in 1942...Among the other accomplishments of this remarkably clear, concise but complicated history is the attention it devotes to American Jews, who were anything but unified during the war...[It] provide[s] the perspective necessary to comprehend the complexities of what have become some of the most painful and politically charged memories in American foreign policy. In short, <i>FDR and the Jews</i> is a narrative that resists the temptations of artificial drama and a work of scholarship that avoids facile categorization.

It follows Dante through all his spectacular range, commanding where he is commanding, wrestling, as he does, with the density and darkness in language and in the soul. This "Inferno gives us Dante's vivid drama and his verbal inventiveness. It is living writing." --James Richardson, Princeton University <br>"Professor Esolen's translation of Dante's "Inferno is the best one I have seen, for two reasons. His decision to use unrhymed blank verse allows him to come nearly as close to the meaning of the original as any prose reading could do, and allows him also to avoid the harrowing sacrifices that the demand for rhyme imposes on any translator. And his endnotes and other additions provoke answers to almost any question that could arise about the work." --A.

Shortly before he died in 1998, Lesslie Newbigin recorded a series of eight radio addresses on basic themes and central figures in the Bible. These addresses, which form the basis of this book, affirm the Bible as the story of the history of humankind. Newbigin invites readers to join him on a journey from Genesis through Revelation, introducing the great biblical figures along the way - Abraham, Moses, Noah, the prophets, Paul, and of course, Jesus. His characteristically lucid prose, reflecting a lifetime of faithful teaching and preaching, both challenges and inspires the reader to a deeper level of Christian discipleship. This authoritative, powerful summary of the Bible story is indispensable reading for individuals, teachers, clergy, and adult study groups. Lesslie Newbigin was a founding bishop of the Church of South India and associate general secretary of the World Council of Churches. He authored numerous books, including Proper Confidence: Faith, Doubt, and Certainty in Christian Discipleship; The Gospel in a Pluralist Society; and Foolishness to the Greeks: The Gospel and Western Culture.</p><p>Lesslie Newbigin was a founding bishop of the Church of South India and associate general secretary of the World Council of Churches.

Some are arcane, some simply hilarious&#x2014;and one editor, Carol Fisher Saller, reads every single one of them. All too often she notes a classic author-editor standoff, wherein both parties refuse to compromise on the "rights" and "wrongs" of prose styling: "This author is giving me a fit." "I wish that I could just DEMAND the use of the serial comma at all times." "My author wants his preface to come at the end of the book. This just seems ridiculous to me. I mean, it&#x2019;s not a <i>post</i>-face."</p><p>In <i>The Subversive Copy Editor</i>, Saller casts aside this adversarial view and suggests new strategies for keeping the peace. Emphasizing habits of carefulness, transparency, and flexibility, she shows copy editors how to build an environment of trust and cooperation. One chapter takes on the difficult author; another speaks to writers themselves. Throughout, the focus is on serving the reader, even if it means breaking "rules" along the way. Saller&#x2019;s own foibles and misadventures provide ample material: "I mess up all the time," she confesses.

Hirschman here offers a new interpretation for the rise of capitalism, one that emphasizes the continuities between old and new, in contrast to the assumption of a sharp break that is a common feature of both Marxian and Weberian thinking. Among the insights presented here is the ironical finding that capitalism was originally supposed to accomplish exactly what was soon denounced as its worst feature: the repression of the passions in favor of the "harmless," if one-dimensional, interests of commercial life. To portray this lengthy ideological change as an endogenous process, Hirschman draws on the writings of a large number of thinkers, including Montesquieu, Sir James Steuart, and Adam Smith.</p></p><p><b>Albert O.

The Sanskrit is presented in both the Indian deva-nagari and in Roman script, together with an interlinear and very literal English translation. This is followed by a translation of each verse into more flowing and readable English. What makes this version so distinct is that every word is analyzed for its grammatical form and given a range of possible English equivalents.

For the next fifteen years, owing in part to changes unleashed by American expansion, Indian warriors launched devastating attacks across ten Mexican states. Raids and counter-raids claimed thousands of lives, ruined much of northern Mexico&#x2019;s economy, depopulated its countryside, and left man-made &#x201c;deserts&#x201d; in place of thriving settlements.

Ambedkar&#x2019;s <i>Annihilation of Caste </i>is one of the most important, yet neglected, works of political writing from India. Written in 1936, it is an audacious denunciation of Hinduism and its caste system. Ambedkar &#x2013; a figure like W.E.B. Du Bois &#x2013; offers a scholarly critique of Hindu scriptures, scriptures that sanction a rigidly hierarchical and iniquitous social system. The world&#x2019;s best-known Hindu, Mahatma Gandhi, responded publicly to the provocation. The hatchet was never buried.<br><br> Arundhati Roy introduces this extensively annotated edition of <i>Annihilation of Caste </i>in &#x201c;The Doctor and the Saint<i>,&#x201d; </i>examining the persistence of caste in modern India, and how the conflict between Ambedkar and Gandhi continues to resonate. Roy takes us to the beginning of Gandhi&#x2019;s political career in South Africa, where his views on race, caste and imperialism were shaped. She tracks Ambedkar&#x2019;s emergence as a major political figure in the national movement, and shows how his scholarship and intelligence illuminated a political struggle beset by sectarianism and obscurantism. Roy breathes new life into Ambedkar&#x2019;s anti-caste utopia, and says that without a Dalit revolution, India will continue to be hobbled by systemic inequality.</p><p><b>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar </b>was born in 1891 into an &#x201c;Untouchable&#x201d; family of modest means. One of India&#x2019;s most radical thinkers, he transformed the social and political landscape in the struggle against British colonialism. He was a prolific writer who oversaw the drafting of the Indian Constitution and served as India&#x2019;s first Law Minister. In 1935, he publicly declared that though he was born a Hindu, he would not die as one. Ambedkar eventually embraced Buddhism, a few months before his death in 1956.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Arundhati Roy </b>is the author of the Booker Prize&#x2013;winning novel <i>The God of Small Things</i>.

Arundhati Roy&#x2019;s essay is punchy, eye-opening and provocative ... There is very little left of the saintly stature of the Mahatma once Roy is done with him, while Ambedkar, quite rightly, is left standing as the man in full control of his senses and his very considerable intellect.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Thomas Blom Hansen</b>, Director, Stanford&#x2019;s Center for South Asia<br><br>&#x201c;This annotated edition of <i>Annihilation of Caste</i> was long overdue ... The copious footnotes give the reader a sense of direction and all the additional information needed for making sense of the text &#x2013; including the translation of the Sanskrit shlokas Ambedkar used to document his analysis.

After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br><br>She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>. She also wrote and illustrated the unique and fascinating book&nbsp;<i>Color</i>, a charming and instructive guide to how art goes through the four color printing process.<br><br>Among the notable people who have had an influence on Heller's writing have been: Ogden Nash, Gilbert and Sullivan, Edward Lear, Hilaire Belloc, and Dr. Seuss. Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."In this latest addition to Heller's expanding collection of parts-of-speech books, the author/artist employs her characteristically vibrant, larger-than-life paintings to examine the many aspects of adverbs. Readers are told--and captivatingly shown--that "ADVERBS work terrifically when answering specifically . . . 'How?' 'How often?' 'When?' and 'Where?' " A glorious blue-and-white Victorian house, for example, drips gingerbread trim across one spread: it was painted "RECENTLY." The question, "WHY do pandas eat bamboo?" is posed against a comparatively spare spread of three beguiling creatures devouring green leaves. If this book is a bit more confusing than the earlier volumes, it is chiefly because of the inherent diversity of the topic--young grammarians may well be puzzled that the words in a bride's vow of "YES, INDEED, FOREVER" are equated with the "how" of "HOW do you do?" Nevertheless, Heller once again offers an informative English lesson that is great fun to read and rife with theatrics.

For as he describes the shabby, cloying, and sometimes terrifying Dublin upbringing of his alter ego, Stephen Dedalus, Joyce immerses the reader in his emerging consciousness, employing language that ranges from baby talk to hellfire sermon to a triumphant artist's manifesto. The result is a novel of immense boldness, eloquence, and energy, a work that inaugurated a literary revolution and has become a model for the portrayal of the self in our time.<br><br>The text of this edition has been newly edited by Hans Walter Gabler and Walter Hettche and is followed by a new afterword, chronology, and bibliography by Richard Brown.</p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettesA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man portrays Stephen&#39;s Dublin childhood and youth and, in doing so, provides an oblique self-portrait of the young James Joyce. At its center are questions of origin and source, authority and authorship, and the relationship of an artist to his family, culture, and race. Exuberantly inventive in its style, the novel subtly and beautifully orchestrates the patterns of quotation and repetition instrumental in its hero&#39;s quest to create his own character, his own language, life, and art: &#34;to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race&#34;.</p><h2>The Merck Manual of Medical Information: Home Edition</h2><p>This best-selling, medical reference is now available in everyday language with comprehensive, accurate information and contributions from over 300 leading medical experts.</p><p>Need to find the definition of a medical term <i>and</i> comprehend it? Need fast information about your child's illness? Need help defining that redness in your eye? Or maybe you need a reality check on the progress of your pregnancy. For the first time, Merck--the leader in medical research since 1899--has opened its treasure chest of medical knowledge to the general public. <p> The team of nearly 200 experts, consultants, and authors has assembled a body of information so vast that listing select items fails to do it justice. <i>The Merck Manual</i> provides reams of useful medical information, ranging from fundamentals such as anatomy to crisp, easily understood descriptions of complicated diseases. Clear drawings of basic anatomical details and helpful sidebars that define terms and proffer advice are invaluable features, as is the up-to-date counsel on choosing the right form of exercise. </p><p> <i>The Merck Manual</i>'s 30-page section on drugs is itself an excellent resource. Here you'll find descriptions of the biological impact of high-powered pharmaceuticals, plus a table of drugs that put the elderly at risk. Its five appendixes on such topics as legal issues and commonly used medical terms segue handily into a guide of institutions that offer information and counseling for a multitude of medical conditions. This exhaustive volume clarifies both the workings of the human body and the geography of its demise, not to mention Western medicine's solutions to its failures. If knowledge is power, buy this book to arm yourself with a world of information.</p><b>Robert Berkow, M.D.,</b> has been editor-in-chief of <i>The Merck Manual</i> since 1974. He is a clinical professor of medicine and psychiatry at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences. Dr. Berkow assembled a group of nearly 200 eminent experts as editorial board members, consultants, and authors. <p> This outstanding group has dedicated five years to the development of <i>The Merck Manual -- Home Edition,</i> ensuring that the information contained within it is complete and easy to use and understand, while meeting the same standards of excellence that healthcare professionals have trusted for nearly a century.</p></p><h2>Bleak House (Penguin English library)</h2><p>This book is one of the classic book of all time.</p><p><i>Bleak House</i> is a satirical look at the Byzantine legal system in London as it consumes the minds and talents of the greedy and nearly destroys the lives of innocents--a contemporary tale indeed. Dickens's tale takes us from the foggy dank streets of London and the maze of the Inns of Court to the peaceful countryside of England. Likewise, the characters run from murderous villains to virtuous girls, from a devoted lover to a "fallen woman," all of whom are affected by a legal suit in which there will, of course, be no winner. The first-person narrative related by the orphan Esther is particularly sweet. The articulate reading by the acclaimed British actor Paul Scofield, whose distinctive broad English accent lends just the right degree of sonority and humor to the text, brings out the color in this classic social commentary disguised as a Victorian drama. However, to abridge Dickens is, well, a Dickensian task, the results of which make for a story in which the author's convoluted plot lines and twists of fate play out in what seems to be a fast-forward format. Listeners must pay close attention in order to keep up with the multiple narratives and cast of curious characters, including the memorable Inspector Bucket and Mr. Guppy. Fortunately, the publisher provides a partial list of characters on the inside jacket. (<i>Running time: 3 hours; 2 cassettes</i>)The classic, definitive, world-famous Nonesuch Press edition of 1937, finally available again and bound in leather and linen.

The Nonesuch edition contains full-color illustrations selected by Dickens himself, by artists including Hablot Knight Browne ("Phiz"), George Cruikshank, John Leech, Robert Seymour, and George Cattermole.<br><br> <i>The Nonesuch Dickens</i> reproduces the original elegance of these beautiful editions.

Written by renowned economist Barry Eichengreen, this classic book emphasizes the importance of the international monetary system for understanding the international economy. Brief and lucid, <i>Globalizing Capital</i> is intended not only for economists, but also a general audience of historians, political scientists, professionals in government and business, and anyone with a broad interest in international relations. Eichengreen demonstrates that the international monetary system can be understood and effectively governed only if it is seen as a historical phenomenon extending from the period of the gold standard to today's world of fluctuating prices. This updated edition continues to document the effect of floating exchange rates and contains a new chapter on the Asian financial crisis, the advent of the euro, the future of the dollar, and related topics. <i>Globalizing Capital</i> shows how these and other recent developments can be put in perspective only once their political and historical contexts are understood.</p></p><p><p>Praise for the first edition: "Eichengreen's purpose is to provide a brief history of the international monetary system.

Justices realize that their ability to achieve their policy and other goals depends on the preferences of other actors, the choices they expect others to make, and the institutional context in which they act. All these factors hold sway over justices as they make their decisions, from which cases to accept, to how to interact with their colleagues, and what policies to adopt in their opinions.</p><p><em>Choices</em> is a thought-provoking, yet nontechnical work that is an ideal supplement for judicial process and public law courses. In addition to offering a unique and sustained theoretical account, the authors tell a fascinating story of how the Court works. Data culled from the Court&#x2032;s public records and from the private papers of Justices Brennan, Douglas, Marshall, and Powell provide empirical evidence to support the central argument, while numerous examples from the justices&#x2032; papers animate the work.</p></p><p><strong>Lee Epstein</strong> is Ethan A.H.

Hailed as the father of modern anatomy and neurobiology, he was largely responsible for the modern conception of the brain. His groundbreaking works were <i>New Ideas on the Structure of the Nervous System</i> and H<i>istology of the Nervous System in Man and Vertebrates</i>. In addition to leaving a legacy of unparalleled scientific research, Cajal sought to educate the novice scientist about how science was done and how he thought it should be done. This recently rediscovered classic, first published in 1897, is an anecdotal guide for the perplexed new investigator as well as a refreshing resource for the old pro.</p><p>Cajal was a pragmatist, aware of the pitfalls of being too idealistic&#x2015;and he had a sense of humor, particularly evident in his diagnoses of various stereotypes of eccentric scientists. The book covers everything from valuable personality traits for an investigator to social factors conducive to scientific work.</p></p><p>Santiago Ram�n y Cajal (1852-1934) was an incredible scientist--he made invaluable contributions to neuroanatomy, including some of the most beautiful scientific illustrations since Vesalius. He was also a popular author, and above all a dedicated teacher, offering fatherly advice to students and young researchers on a wide range of topics. After he achieved success as a scientist, he wrote the first edition of <i>Reglas y Consejos sobre Investigaci�n Biol�gia (los tonicos de la voluntad)</i> (1916). That work has been retranslated and presented by MIT Press as <i>Advice for a Young Investigator</i>. Although the wisdom contained in this slim, elegant volume is almost a century old, it is as fresh and useful today as it no doubt was then. What student or researcher wouldn't benefit from advice given by a mentor who has carefully examined his own life and career? Translator Larry Swanson writes in the foreword:<p> </p><blockquote>Hard work, ambition, patience, humility, seriousness, and passion for work, family, and country were among the traits he considered essential. But above all, master technique and produce original data; all the rest will follow.</blockquote><p> Cajal's guidance on such things as the scientific method, resolve, undue admiration of authority, passion for reputation, reading, and "diseases of the will" is priceless. Every page of this little book is filled with read-aloud gems:</p><p> </p><blockquote>If a solution fails to appear after all of this, and yet we feel success is just around the corner, try resting for a while.... Like the early morning frost, this intellectual refreshment withers the parasitic and nasty vegetation that smothers the good seed. Bursting forth at last is the flower of truth.</blockquote><p> Whether you're writing a dissertation, conquering writer's block to get that paper submitted to a journal, beginning a new research project, or just starting out in a scientific career, <i>Advice for a Young Investigator</i> will inspire, edify, and amuse you. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>Neely Swanson is a scholar of romance languages.<br><br>Larry W.

This edition includes two related short pieces by Gaskell, "The Last Generation in England" and "The Cage at Cranford." Dinah Birch's introduction reflects recent revaluations of Gaskell's work and the growing recognition that <em>Cranford</em> is much more than the gently charming comedy that is was once taken to be. The book includes an up-to-date bibliography and expanded notes.<br></p><p>In this witty and poignant comedy of early-Victorian life, Elizabeth Gaskell chronicles a small Cheshire market town on the verge of great change.Elizabeth Gaskell&#x2019;s episodic second novel, sometimes dismissed as nostalgically "charming," is now considered by many critics to be her most sophisticated work. The country town of Cranford is home to a group of women, affectionately called "Amazons" by the narrator, whose seemingly uneventful lives are full of conflicts, failures, and unexpected connections. A rich commentary on Victorian culture by one of its most astute observers, Cranford owes its enduring popularity to the complex pleasures it offers the reader. This Broadview Edition provides an assortment of historical materials to put the novel in context, including Gaskell's letters from the period of the novel's writing, excerpts from texts read by the characters, illustrations from the novel and from contemporary periodicals, and other Victorian writings on industrialization, etiquette, and domestic life.</p><h2>Animal Physiology: From Genes to Organisms</h2><p>Keep up with today&#39;s rapid advances in the biological sciences with ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY: FROM GENES TO ORGANISMS 2E with CourseMate!

The day Apollo 11 landed on the moon. But it is only one piece of a magnificent story. Mission Control, This Is Apollo, by the acclaimed Andrew Chaikin (author of A Man on the Moon, basis of the HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon), recounts space history from the Mercury missions through Apollo 17 and beyond. It is illustrated with stunning full-color paintings by astronaut Alan Bean, who walked on the moon with Pete Conrad on Apollo 12 and has devoted his post-NASA life to creating art. Handsome, informative, and dramatic, this is no textbook?it is the tale of humankind&#39;s greatest adventure in the last frontier: space.Book Details:Format: HardcoverPublication Date: 5/28/2009Pages: 128Reading Level: Age 8 and Up</p><p>Andrew Chaikin is the author of the acclaimed <i>A Man on the Moon</i> and several other books about space. He is a commentator for NPR&#x2019;s <i>Morning Edition</i> and had appeared on <i>Good Morning America, Nightline, Fresh Air</i>, and <i>Talk of the Nation</i>.Starred Review. Grade 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;Along with being based at least as much on personal interviews as on documentary and other sources, this album-sized history of the Apollo missions is also set apart by its unique illustrations. A former astronaut who walked on the Moon as part of the <i>Apollo 12</i> crew, Bean has been for many years a full-time fine artist. He incorporates into moonscapes, spacecraft, and suited-up astronauts done over the course of his artistic career not only an unusually personal perspective, but also actual bits of moon dust, used mission patches, and other well-traveled memorabilia. He also provides illuminating, sometimes eloquent commentary in captions and a closing statement. Though the authors present an uncomplicated version of events with almost no discussion of the exclusion of women from the astronaut corps, for instance, and quoting Neil Armstrong's famous line as "one small step for a man" rather than what he actually said, they do tuck in memorable anecdotes (to the question "What's the most beautiful thing you saw in space?" an astronaut replies, "Urine dump at sunset"). They effectively highlight the Apollo program's magnificent achievements, as well as its moments of tension and tragedy. Supplemented with an admixture of photos and labeled diagrams, the large-scale art adds a dazzling visual element to this grand commemoration.&#x2014;<i>John Peters, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He will journey through Russia and buy up, at reduced rates, the recently deceased serfs of landowners, who now won&#x2019;t have to pay government taxes on the &#x2018;dead souls.&#x2019; With this list of fictitious serfs as collateral, Chichikov can buy an estate and begin amassing his fortune. What follows is a series of grotesquely humorous transactions with Russian landowners, each more queer and repellant than the last. Although Gogol spends much of the novel exposing the evils of the Russian gentry through absurd and hilarious satire, he also expresses a passionate love for his country that resonates with readers even today.&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;RA stylistic tour de force, encompassing an astonishing range of voices from delicate, intimate lyricism to robust, bawdy ribaldry, &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RDead Souls&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R is an intensely felt anatomy of the human condition.&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LSTRONG&amp;&amp;RJeffrey Meyers&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R,&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, has published forty-three books, including biographies of Ernest Hemingway, Robert Frost, D.

H. Lawrence, Joseph Conrad, and George Orwell. He also wrote the Introductions and Notes to the Barnes &amp; Noble Classics editions of Edith Wharton&#x2019;s <i>The House of Mirth</i> and Rudyard Kipling&#x2019;s <i>Kim.</i><br><b>From Jeffrey Meyers&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>Dead Souls<br></i><br></b><p>Like Edgar Allan Poe, born the same year, Gogol suffered from poverty and had grandiose literary ambitions. They came from different countries, had different languages and cultures, and probably never heard of each other, but they were surprisingly similar. Like Poe, Gogol moved restlessly from place to place, shamelessly sponged off family and friends, read his works aloud with dramatic effect, used several pseudonyms (including the cryptic &#x201c;0000&#x201d;), was interested in fashionable clothing and interior d�cor, allowed cats to play intriguing parts in his tales, failed to finish major projects, poached from obscure sources, claimed knowledge he didn&#x2019;t have, suffered delusions of grandeur, and was driven by suicidal impulses. Poe drank himself to death; Gogol starved himself to death. </p><p>Like Poe, Gogol was strongly influenced by the German writer E. T. A. Hoffmann, who depicted pathological states and criminal impulses, and created a disturbing atmosphere by combining factual reality with grotesque fantasies. Both Poe and Gogol had a strong element of sadomasochism in their lives and their imaginations, and wrote tortuous and often outrageous books with &#x201c;Arabesque&#x201d; in the titles. They had a haunted, hallucinatory vision, with idealized dead women rising from the grave to harm the living and the Devil himself making a menacing appearance. Both used caricature and melodrama, emphasized the eccentric and bizarre aspects of human experience, and portrayed the lower depths of society. Both described incest and violent retribution, the nightmare of urban isolation, the power of the supernatural, and the horrific as well as the precarious instability, psychological disintegration, and mental collapse of their self-destructive heroes. Gogol&#x2019;s tale &#x201c;The Diary of a Madman&#x201d; describes the sort of unbalanced first-person narrator who appears in many of Poe&#x2019;s stories. </p><p>Gogol&#x2019;s appearance and character matched his weird behavior. An actor portrayed him as both foppish and slovenly: &#x201c;Of medium height, blond, with a huge wig, wearing gold-rimmed spectacles on his long, birdlike nose, with squinting little eyes, and firmly compressed, as if bit-together, lips.&#x201d; Turgenev, who hadn&#x2019;t seen Gogol for fifteen years, met him in Moscow in 1851 and, with a novelist&#x2019;s eye, deduced his character from his unattractive, vulpine (rather than birdlike) appearance: </p><p>His fair hair, which fell straight from the temples, as is usual with Cossacks, still preserved its youthful tint, but had thinned noticeably; his smooth, retreating white forehead conveyed, as before, the impression of great intelligence. His small brown eyes sparkled with gaiety at times&#x2014;yes, gaiety and not sarcasm; but mostly they looked tired. Gogol&#x2019;s long, pointed nose gave his face a sort of cunning, fox-like expression; his puffy, soft lips under the clipped moustache also produced an unfavourable impression; in their indefinite contours&#x2014;so at least it seemed to me&#x2014;the dark sides of his character found expression. When he spoke, they opened unpleasantly, showing a row of bad teeth. His small chin disappeared into his wide, black velvet cravat. </p><p></p><p>Another friend, who unexpectedly called on Gogol when he was writing, was astonished by his exotic, theatrical dress: &#x201c;Before me stood Gogol in the following fantastic get-up: in place of boots&#x2014;long Russian woolen stockings, which reached above the knee; instead of a jacket&#x2014;a velvet spencer [short, double-breasted overcoat] over a flannel camisole, with a large, bright-colored scarf wrapped around his neck and a raspberry-colored, velvet kokoshnik, embroidered in gold, on his head, quite similar to the headdress of Finnish tribeswomen.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Western Civilization, A Brief History</h2><p>WESTERN CIVILIZATION: A BRIEF HISTORY, Eleventh Edition, offers a concise introduction to political, cultural, and intellectual history.

It's not just that the grid has grown old and is now in dire need of basic repair. Today, as we invest great hope in new energy sources--solar, wind, and other alternatives--the grid is what stands most firmly in the way of a brighter energy future. If we hope to realize this future, we need to reimagine the grid according to twenty-first-century values. It's a project which forces visionaries to work with bureaucrats, legislators with storm-flattened communities, moneymen with hippies, and the left with the right. And though it might not yet be obvious, this revolution is already well under way.</p><p> Cultural anthropologist Gretchen Bakke unveils the many facets of America's energy infrastructure, its most dynamic moments and its most stable ones, and its essential role in personal and national life. The grid, she argues, is an essentially American artifact, one which developed with us: a product of bold expansion, the occasional foolhardy vision, some genius technologies, and constant improvisation. Most of all, her focus is on how Americans are changing the grid right now, sometimes with gumption and big dreams and sometimes with legislation or the brandishing of guns.</p><p><i>The Grid</i> tells--entertainingly, perceptively--the story of what has been called "the largest machine in the world": its fascinating history, its problematic present, and its potential role in a brighter, cleaner future.</p></p><p><p><b>Gretchen Bakke </b>holds a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in Cultural Anthropology.

These critics of vision, especially prominent in twentieth-century France, have challenged its allegedly superior capacity to provide access to the world. They have also criticized its supposed complicity with political and social oppression through the promulgation of spectacle and surveillance.<br><br>Martin Jay turns to this discourse surrounding vision and explores its often contradictory implications in the work of such influential figures as Jean-Paul Sartre, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan, Louis Althusser, Guy Debord, Luce Irigaray, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida. Jay begins with a discussion of the theory of vision from Plato to Descartes, then considers its role in the French Enlightenment before turning to its status in the culture of modernity. From consideration of French Impressionism to analysis of Georges Bataille and the Surrealists, Roland Barthes's writings on photography, and the film theory of Christian Metz, Jay provides lucid and fair-minded accounts of thinkers and ideas widely known for their difficulty.<br><br>His book examines the myriad links between the interrogation of vision and the pervasive antihumanist, antimodernist, and counter-enlightenment tenor of much recent French thought. Refusing, however, to defend the dominant visual order, he calls instead for a plurality of "scopic regimes." Certain to generate controversy and discussion throughout the humanities and social sciences, <i>Downcast Eyes</i> will consolidate Jay's reputation as one of today's premier cultural and intellectual historians.</p><p><b>Martin Jay</b> is Sidney Hellman Ehrman Professor of History at the University of California, Berkeley.

The most powerful effect of Jay's study is to convey how beliefs about the eye and 'the gaze' (as Sartre called the objectifying vision of strangers) found coherent views about human self-understanding and political analysis. . . .

(<i>Journal of Modern History</i>)<br><br>". . . .[<i>Downcast Eyes</i>] expands the vision of cultural studies by providing a new account of how critical theory can extend (rather than denounce) the Enlightenment and a new example of how synthetic intellectual history can contribute to (rather than impede) well-informed critical thinking."

After giving a comprehensive description of what composites are and how they work, the book breaks the materials down into their constituents; different types of fibers; carbon, aramid, glass, and others; matrix materials; ceramics, thermoplastic and specifically thermoset resins and their different chemistries. It then goes into detail about design considerations and guidelines, various tooling concepts, manufacturing methods, and accepted repair theories and concepts.

How they got here, persevered, and ultimately thrived is a story that resonates from the Pleistocene to our modern era. The lower sea levels of the Ice Age exposed a vast land bridge between Asia and North America, but the land bridge was not the only way across. Different people arrived from different directions, and not all at the same time.<br><br>The first explorers of the New World were few, their encampments fleeting. The continent they reached had no people but was inhabited by megafauna&#x2014;mastodons, giant bears, mammoths, saber-toothed cats, five-hundred-pound panthers, enormous bison, and sloths that stood one story tall. The first people were hunters&#x2014;Paleolithic spear points are still encrusted with the proteins of their prey&#x2014;but they were wildly outnumbered and many would themselves have been prey to the much larger animals.<br><i><br>Atlas of a Lost World</i> chronicles the last millennia of the Ice Age, the violent oscillations and retreat of glaciers, the clues and traces that document the first encounters of early humans, and the animals whose presence governed the humans&#x2019; chances for survival.&nbsp;A blend of science and personal narrative reveals how much has changed since the time of mammoth hunters, and how little. Across unexplored landscapes yet to be peopled, readers will see the Ice Age, and their own age, in a whole new light.</p><p><b>CRAIG CHILDS</b> is the author of <i>Apocalyptic Planet.</i> He has been a regular commentator for NPR's <i>Morning Edition,</i> and his work has appeared in <i>The New York Times,</i> the<i> Los Angeles Times, Men's Journal, Outside, The Sun,</i> and <i>Orion Magazine.</i>&nbsp;Awards he has received include the Ellen Meloy Desert Writers Award, the Rowell Award for the Art of Adventure, the Sigurd F.

The first inkling of new life was the white light of a headlamp and the scratch of small metal tools.<br>&nbsp;<br>I lay on my side with my hard hat off, working on a camel that had died back here, an awkward place for anything to die, I thought. It was in a crack in the back side of a small chamber, which is why they gave the site to me. I was in my early thirties, base camp cook for a museum crew working on one of the most prolific Pleistocene bone-producing sites in the American West&#x2014;Porcupine Cave in the mountains of south-central Colorado&#x2014;churning out rodent bones for the most part, with the occasional hoorah of discovering skeletal cheetah kittens, the toe bones of horses, cores of bison horns. Else�where, a dozen excavators and screeners were pulling up a treasure trove of Pleistocene porcupines and squirrels, filling and labeling bags, while I was alone in a hole with <i>Camelops </i>hesternus<i>.</i> I imagined the camel crawling into the cave, its hindquarters slashed by saber�tooths or hamstrung by dire wolves, trying to save itself, dying here.<br>&nbsp;<br>When silver miners first blasted into the mountainside in the 1860s, they accidentally clipped one of the cave&#x2019;s chambers. So they propped up the tunnel with wooden posts and beams. Then they dropped into it with their oil-wick lamps and found passageways, crystals, and domed rooms&#x2014;floors buried in dust, bones sealed in place three hundred thousand years ago. Now, a ladder brought pale�ontologists down through the hole the miners opened. They moved through the rotten molasses smell of woodrat urine into the dark, crawling through low spots, pushing gear ahead, headlamps shining on each other&#x2019;s boot soles. They went to their own trenches and pits, screens and vacuums, setting up grids, fingers picking through count�less rodent bones. I went to the camel.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>***</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Is it safe for idiots?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;None of this is safe for idiots,&#x201d; said David Stevenson, my friend and mentor, a soul-brother who would turn sixty while we were out on the ice. He said this as we looked across an empty expanse of mountains and glaciers, nothing but rock and whiteness before us.<br>&nbsp;<br>A mountaineering author and book review editor for the American Alpine Journal, Stevenson was the de facto leader of our group of five heading for the Harding Icefield, one of the largest remaining ice masses in North America. He and I had taken a few quick trips and mountain climbs in the Chugach Range outside his home in Anchorage, finding good company with each other, enough to plan this venture. Stevenson was here to ascend his first nunatak, an Ice�landic word for a mountain summit stabbed through ice, a castle of rock completely isolated. It was on his bucket list, and the Harding has plenty. Stevenson and I assembled a small ice- crossing tribe, carrying rope, sleds, skis, and gear on the first load a few thousand feet into the mountains at the edge of the Harding, a giant glacier poured like latex into the crown of the Kenai Mountains. The neck of a ukulele poked out of the top of my pack, gift of a woman we met at the trailhead on the freshly snowed valley floor. None of us knew how to play the instrument, but we brought it anyway. With a pack weight of around eighty pounds each, what&#x2019;s the difference? Going into the unknown, talismans might come in handy. It was late May. Forty- seven inches of snow had fallen across the Kenai the week before, and ahead lay frozen, treeless earth. I kicked in step after step, counting my breaths under my load, thinking like a Sherpa, or trying to: Fifty steps and rest, fifty steps and rest. I stopped and leaned my weight over my poles, looking up at the two people climbing above me, their shadows flashing against a golden ball of sun, Stevenson breaking a steep, knee-deep trail for the rest of us. I looked down past the other two kicking their way up behind me. The ladder of our tracks disappeared below them, slipping over an edge. Two thousand feet below, a forested valley was melting out of the snow. A glacial river threw question marks across a plain of gray and rocky outwash. I could still make out the road we&#x2019;d come in on, a meager ribbon to a dead end, a farewell. People once traveled at the speed of two feet, or possibly a paddled boat, but no faster. Most of our evolution was at this pace, one step and the next. The way we zoom around in cars and planes has changed the way we understand the dimensions of geography. Distances are abstract, unapproachable; what you see when you open the shade on an oval window in an airplane and look down thirty thousand feet is walkable land, mesas and mountains appearing ahead, vanishing behind. In the Ice Age, to know about a place was to have been there, or at least heard tell of it. Word of new places came in the form of birds from far away and a different grit to the rivers. We&#x2019;d left in a window, a swing season. Too early, and you could be pinned down for weeks in late spring whiteouts. Too late, and snow would start melting off the ice, turning its surface into a web of blue-eyed lakes, waterfalls roaring into widening crevasses. This is when you would have gone in the late Pleistocene, a keyhole to slip through. Some Ice Age summers would have been warm enough that meltwater lakes would be forming and bursting across the face of the ice sheet. But most summers would have been frozen solid, nothing but snow accumulation. If we hit it right, a couple thousand feet above here we would drop our sleds, snap into skis, load gear behind us, and strike off like mariners across the Harding. Doing this would require an advanced base camp, where we could leave extra gear and supplies for a round trip. Ice Age people would have done the same, setting a cache for a return. They may have been crazy, but they weren&#x2019;t idiots.<br>&nbsp;<br>The first night, we camped on a mountain&#x2019;s shoulder. Clouds filled the valley, but up here we had a clear sky in the long blue light of an Alaskan evening. A glacier poured a hundred feet below us, its blue-bellied crevasses pillared with snow where it came off the icefield. We clinked cups together, celebrating our first load. The two older guys on the trip, Stevenson and his lifelong climbing buddy, John McIn�erney, who was fifty-nine, had brought Scotch whiskey. They called it the drink of mountaineers. They added clumps of snow instead of ice and raised a toast to a safe and meaningful journey onto the Harding. I toasted back home to my kids and my wife, their pictures carried in the top of my pack.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>***</b><br>&nbsp;<br>In New Mexico, we sat in the scrape and bluster of a windstorm, zinc-colored clouds whipping off the evaporated lake around us. We used our backs as shields and ate sausage, cheese, and mayonnaise, our bites gritty with gypsum. We&#x2019;d left a camp in the dunes and were walking the alkali flats along a high edge of Ancestral Lake Otero. Storm clouds split into ghost fingers through the mountains and streamed over the dead lake.<br>&nbsp;<br>We weren&#x2019;t far from Pendejo Cave, a day or two&#x2019;s walk to this rock�shelter in the side of a mesa that would have looked across the south end of the lake. Its name, pendejo, is a bitter curse in Spanish. The cave is a crummy little space, not quite as nice as Paisley Caves, a rough shelter where you could cook or sleep if you had to. Archae�ologists thought they&#x2019;d found a thirty-six-thousand-year-old human artifact here, as well as human skin prints in what had been damp sediment from the same age. Those dates, however, fell through, and scientists now say the oldest human presence at Pendejo appears in flakes and charcoal laid down about thirteen thousand years ago. This puts them in an early Clovis trajectory. A rough day in the field, giant cats out stalking the lake edge hungry for anything, bad weather . . . whatever drove them to this shelter kept them there long enough to leave rock chips and campfires.<br>&nbsp;<br>On the lakebed, there was no shelter. Jordan was nervous about coming out this far. We were seeing more impact craters and military ephemera, shrapnel and wind-blasted pieces of equipment, though we hadn&#x2019;t yet seen the fence marking the edge of the missile range. Jordan kept asking who the trip leader was, who was making the deci�sions. He looked at me as he spoke, and said my name a number of times. I was trying to eat lunch and my eyeballs were sore. I told him we were all out here of our own volition, and it is perfectly legal to traverse the edge of a bombing range on public lands. Jordan said that was fine, he would do anything, he&#x2019;d jump a fence on the range if necessary, but what, he asked, were we doing, besides sightseeing on a dead lake.<br>&nbsp;<br>Beyond us was a dead zone, a scattered museum of war history, small parts of vehicles and sequential holes from long-ago straf�ing runs. Nick found a .50 caliber bullet. He turned it to show the butt, marked where the primer had been hit. The number &#x201c;43&#x201d; was imprinted at the edge. His eyes gleamed. &#x201c;It was made in 1943,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>Meaning, it was from another age. Pre-atomic bomb, before depleted uranium was repurposed into tank-piercing projectiles. Of all of us, Nick was the best historian, having the strongest sense of what is at stake. In this bullet, he held a story from before the Atomic Age, before the world shifted. He knew what modern weapons meant. He&#x2019;d pulled live bombs out of car trunks, puzzling over their many wires. A trail of blood led into the desert. A body shot through with shrapnel slumped against a steering wheel. He could smell the smol�dering around him as he pondered booby traps within booby traps.<br>&nbsp;<br>This may be why I seek the older stories. I flee to them, crawling into their caves for sanctuary. But I know better. It was no easier thir�teen thousand years ago. We live within the same ranges of tension, going as far as we can without snapping regardless of the century or millennia. Bronze Age �tzi was cut and wounded days before his death, and a flint arrowhead had been shot through his back into his shoulder; he probably bled to death where it cut an artery. Nine-thousand-year-old Kennewick Man in Washington State had a stone projectile embedded in his hip, the wound healed, bone grown over the artifact. A human burial on St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea revealed a skeleton pierced by fifteen barbed points made of bone, one skewered clean through the spinal column from behind. These were no easy deaths. If it wasn&#x2019;t being eaten alive by wild animals, it was someone throwing a spear at you, or maybe many spears. Nick knew this better than any of us.<br>&nbsp;<br>I told the others to keep their eyes out for anything older than mili�tary artifacts, oddities sticking up from the playa, differently colored splotches of ground in a pattern. Mammoths wouldn&#x2019;t have left much and chances of finding anything in the course of a day&#x2019;s ramble across emptiness seemed slim. The tracks would be round expressions, like pancakes, or like badly cooked omelets. Ephemeral, washing away, they might be hardly more than discolorations raised an eighth of an inch from the ground.<br>&nbsp;<br>When we found a trackway, I didn&#x2019;t know what I was seeing, or which way the mammoth was heading. One splotch, then two, a left-right pattern, some missing, some barely visible, seven prints in total. Jordan no longer cared how far out we were. We&#x2019;d found something extraordinary.<br>&nbsp;<br>This had been a Columbian mammoth, the tracks circular, decayed, and toeless. There would be no scientific report on the find. We&#x2019;d never be able to find these again or explain where they were, compass bearings too vague on this expanse, no GPS to drop a way�point. I walked alongside the tracks, and the mammoth rose up from the ground, its body filled in by my mind&#x2019;s eye. It didn&#x2019;t seem to notice me, it was focused ahead, tusks swaying back and forth as it traveled. It had hair, with rough brownish or gray skin visible underneath, but it was not woolly like its northern cousins, with which this species bred along the northern margins of its territory. This mammoth was a deep continental animal. It may have never seen its smaller woolly cousins.<br>&nbsp;<br>With proboscideans, you can&#x2019;t tell by a simple track which way it was heading without seeing its toes. Nor can you tell how fast it was moving, elephants having only one gait, no sprint or gallop. All I could tell is that a mammoth had been here&#x2014;this mammoth had been here. The tracks would have connected to trails coming in from the Jornada and from the mesas to the south. If they were anything like modern elephants, mammoths reused old routes, pounding them deeply into the ground. You would have seen their trails coming and going from all directions to this lake.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mammoth tracks have also been found along a former lakeshore in Alberta, documented in fine-enough detail that researchers have been able to determine the population dynamics. Known as Wally&#x2019;s Beach, the site indicates a declining mammoth population at the end of the Pleistocene. The Alberta tracks show the same herd demo�graphics of African elephants that have been battered by poaching and drought, the adults more numerous than juveniles. In a healthy African herd, juveniles represent 60 percent of individuals. A declin�ing herd is 30 percent juveniles. That is what is seen at Wally&#x2019;s Beach. By the end of the Ice Age, mammoths were on their way out. There have been at least nine ice ages over the last seven hundred thousand years. The mammoths were weakened each time one ended, but they survived and rebounded to face the next go-round. This time they did not make it. For them, the last Ice Age was the end. <br>&nbsp;<br>After the seventh track, the prints washed away. The mammoth kept going, walking until it was only a space in the air. I felt as if I were the one retreating, the one left behind as the mammoth lum�bered into nothing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Charlotte dropped to her knees about twenty feet from the tracks and pushed both hands firmly into the earth, giving an extra heave with her shoulders. She made two perfect handprints and scrawled the year of our arrival next to them, prints that would vanish in the next storm. This was our story. One geologic era later, mammoth hunters had found their quarry.</p><h2>HMH Geometry: Teacher Edition with Solutions 2015</h2><p>HMH Geometry: Teacher Edition with Solutions 2015</p><p></p><h2>The Formation of A Persecuting Society: Power and Deviance In Western Europe, 950 - 1250</h2><p>The Tenth to the Thirteenth centuries in Europe saw the appearance of popular heresy and the establishment of the inquisition; expropriation and mass murder of Jews; the foundation of leper hospitals in large numbers and the propagation of elaborate measures to segregate lepers from the healthy. These have traditionally been seen as distinct and separate developments, and explained in terms of the problems which their victims presented to medieval society. In this stimulating book Robert Moore argues that the coincidences in the treatment of these and other minority groups cannot be explained independently, and that all are part of a pattern of persecution which now appeared for the first time to make Europe become, as it has remained, a persecuting society.</p><p><b>R.

"He searched and dared everything."<br><br>Written between 1837 and 1843, <b>Lost Illusions</b> reveals, perhaps better than any other of Balzac's ninety-two novels, the nature and scope of his genius. The story of Lucien Chardon, a young poet from Angoul�me who tries desperately to make a name for himself in Paris, is a brilliantly realistic and boldly satirical portrait of provincial manners and aristocratic life. Handsome and ambitious but na�ve, Lucien is patronized by the beau monde as represented by Madame de Bargeton and her cousin, the formidable Marquise d'Espard, only to be duped by them. Denied the social rank he thought would be his, Lucien discards his poetic aspirations and turns to hack journalism; his descent into Parisian low life ultimately leads to his own death.<br><br>"Balzac was both a greedy child and an indefatigable observer of a greedy age, at once a fantastic and a genius, yet possessing a simple core of common sense," noted V. S. Pritchett, one of his several biographers. Another, Andr� Maurois, concluded: "Balzac was by turns a saint, a criminal, an honest judge, a corrupt judge, a minister, a fob, a harlot, a duchess, and always a genius." <br><br>This Modern Library edition presents the translation by Kathleen Raine.</p><p><br>The Modern Library of the World's<br>Best Books<br><br>"All Balzac's characters are endowed with the zest for life with which he himself was animated. All his fabrications are<br> as intensely colored as dreams. From the highest ranks of the aristocracy to the lowest dregs of society, all the actors in his<br> Comedie are more eager for life, more energetic and cunning in their struggles, more patient in misfortune, more greedy in pleasure, more angelic in devotion than they are in the comedy of the real world. In a word, everyone in Balzac has genius....Every living soul is a weapon loaded to the very muzzle with will."<br><p><br></p><p>--Charles Baudelaire</p>Richard Howard is a Pultizer-Prize winning poet and translator.

We're barely making ends meet. <p>You would think that our wastrel ways are over, we're erasing debt, and stocking up on savings. The reality is that not only are we spenders who barely understand the concept of frugality, we are big spenders on expensive elite brands, and we do it in an attempt to emulate the rich people we see on television, in magazines, and down the street. The recession may have caused us to take a breather, but every indication is that we will pick up right where we left off when gentler economic winds blow again.</p> <p>Before you spend another dime, read this book and understand how to become rich instead of act rich. <i>Stop Acting Rich . . . And Start Living Like a Real Millionaire</i> will upend every assumption you have about wealthy people: where they shop, what they buy, and most shockingly, where they live (it's not where you think).</p> <p>Did you know that three times more millionaires live in homes valued at under $300,000 than over $1 million?

Real millionaires understand that living in communities where their neighbors have less net worth than they do naturally leads to spending less.

And Start Living Like a Real Millionaire</i> rips the lid off just about every assumption we have about what rich looks like.

Ed and Nicole Hoyt are married assassins-for-hire living in the San Fernando Valley. Except for deadly aim with a handgun, the two couples have little in common until they are both hired to do damage control on the same murder case. The previous spring, after days of torrential rain, a body was recovered from one of the city&#x2019;s overwhelmed storm sewers. The victim was identified as James Ballantine, a middle-aged African-American who worked as a research scientist for a prestigious company and was well liked by his colleagues. But two bullets to the back of the head looked like nothing if not foul play. Now, with the case turning cold, Ballantine&#x2019;s former employers bring in the Abels to succeed where the police have failed, while the Hoyts&#x2019; mysterious contractors want to make sure that the facts about Ballantine&#x2019;s death stay hidden.

Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate.

High in a dark room, away from the rest of the house, lies her young cousin Colin, who believes he is an incurable invalid, destined to die young. His tantrums are so frightful, no one can reason with him. If only, Mary hopes, she can get Colin to love the secret garden as much as she does, its magic wil work wonders on him.</p></p><h2>A Book Forged in Hell: Spinoza&#39;s Scandalous Treatise and the Birth of the Secular Age</h2><p>When it appeared in 1670, Baruch Spinoza&#39;s Theological-Political Treatise was denounced as the most dangerous book ever published--&#34;godless,&#34; &#34;full of abominations,&#34; &#34;a book forged in hell . . . by the devil himself.&#34; Religious and secular authorities saw it as a threat to faith, social and political harmony, and everyday morality, and its author was almost universally regarded as a religious subversive and political radical who sought to spread atheism throughout Europe. Yet Spinoza&#39;s book has contributed as much as the Declaration of Independence or Thomas Paine&#39;s Common Sense to modern liberal, secular, and democratic thinking. In A Book Forged in Hell, Steven Nadler tells the fascinating story of this extraordinary book: its radical claims and their background in the philosophical, religious, and political tensions of the Dutch Golden Age, as well as the vitriolic reaction these ideas inspired. It is not hard to see why Spinoza&#39;s Treatise was s</p><p><p>"Steven Nadler's knowledge of the many influences acting on Spinoza is profound. He is as sensitive to Spinoza's reactions to Descartes and Maimonides as to the philosopher's fears of the conservative religious forces that were threatening the Dutch Republic of his day. The wide context that Nadler provides makes for a reading of Spinoza's treatise which is unfailingly rich, nuanced, and illuminating."--<b>Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, author of <i>Betraying Spinoza: The Renegade Jew Who Gave Us Modernity</i></b></p><p>"If there is a single theme that runs throughout Spinoza's writings, Steven Nadler says, 'it is the liberation from bondage, whether psychological, political, or religious.' Spinoza's importance as a philosopher--maybe as the philosopher of modernity--hinges on that. This Amsterdam Jew was one of the grandest and boldest mold-breakers of all time. Nadler gives us a clean, crisp, indispensible account of what made Spinoza's Treatise so revolutionary."--<b>Russell Shorto, author of <i>Descartes' Bones</i></b></p><p>"<i>A Book Forged in Hell</i> is more than just an excellent and highly readable introduction to one of the most important texts of philosophy and political thought. Steven Nadler provides an eloquent portrait of Spinoza's treatise, placing it firmly in its historical, religious, political, and philosophical setting."--<b>Jonathan Israel, author of <i>A Revolution of the Mind: Radical Enlightenment and the Intellectual Origins of Modern Democracy</i></b></p><p>"This is an excellent book. Steven Nadler's wonderfully elegant and fluid writing style makes difficult ideas accessible and exciting without watering them down. A prime virtue of the book is that it provides just enough biographical and historical background to make the philosophy come alive and to reveal what a dramatic work Spinoza's treatise is."--<b>Michael Della Rocca, Yale University</b></p><b>Steven Nadler</b> is the William H.

In <i>The Puppet and the Dwarf</i> he offers a close reading of today's religious constellation from the viewpoint of Lacanian psychoanalysis. He critically confronts both predominant versions of today's spirituality&#x2015;New Age gnosticism and deconstructionist-Levinasian Judaism&#x2015;and then tries to redeem the "materialist" kernel of Christianity. His reading of Christianity is explicitly political, discerning in the Pauline community of believers the first version of a revolutionary collective. Since today even advocates of Enlightenment like Jurgen Habermas acknowledge that a religious vision is needed to ground our ethical and political stance in a "postsecular" age, this book&#x2015;with a stance that is clearly materialist and at the same time indebted to the core of the Christian legacy&#x2015;is certain to stir controversy.</p></p><p>Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek, a philosopher and cultural critic, is Senior Researcher in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and International Director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities at the University of London.

But how many people realize that physics can be used to produce many astonishing and strikingly elegant solutions in mathematics? Mark Levi shows how in this delightful book, treating readers to a host of entertaining problems and mind-bending puzzlers that will amuse and inspire their inner physicist. Levi turns math and physics upside down, revealing how physics can simplify proofs and lead to quicker solutions and new theorems, and how physical solutions can illustrate why results are true in ways lengthy mathematical calculations never can. Did you know it&#39;s possible to derive the Pythagorean theorem by spinning a fish tank filled with water? Or that soap film holds the key to determining the cheapest container for a given volume? Or that the line of best fit for a data set can be found using a mechanical contraption</p><p><p>"What a fun book! Mark Levi's physical arguments are so clever and surprising that they made me laugh with pleasure, again and again. <i>The Mathematical Mechanic</i> is downright magical--a real treat for anyone who loves intuition."<b>--Steven Strogatz, author of <i>Sync: How Order Emerges from Chaos in the Universe, Nature, and Daily Life</i></b></p><p>"This is an absolutely delightful book, full of surprises--even for mathematicians like myself--and beautifully written. It can be enjoyed by anyone, from someone just learning calculus to professional mathematicians and physicists."<b>--Louis Nirenberg, recipient of the National Medal of Science</b></p><p>"This is an extraordinary book that only Mark Levi could have written. No one interested in mathematics or physics can fail to be amazed and delighted. It is witty and charming as well as deep, and accessible with very little background required--a tour de force!"<b>--Nancy Kopell, Boston University, MacArthur Fellow</b></p><p>"The most imaginative and charming book on mechanics and geometry in the last fifty years--for lighting up tea times, for thrilling classrooms, as a present for a special friend, as company on a desert island."<b>--Tadashi Tokieda, University of Cambridge</b></p><p>"This book shows how many mathematical theorems can be proved by looking at them in mechanical or geometrical terms. I found it to be very interesting and fun to read. I recommend it most enthusiastically."<b>--Joseph Keller, recipient of the National Medal of Science</b></p><p>"<i>The Mathematical Mechanic</i> jazzes up the old married couple, math and physics. The book breathes fresh air into the (sometimes stale) relationship and invites us to rethink familiar topics in unfamiliar ways. It disorients us in the most delightful manner. Mark Levi's razor-edge writing and gentle humor permeate every page. I will turn to this book again and again for inspiration on teaching math to high school students."<b>--Gregory Somers, State College Area High School, recipient of the Edyth May Sliffe Award for Distinguished Mathematics Teaching</b></p><p>"This book is a fresh, insightful, and highly original presentation of mathematical physics that will appeal to a broad spectrum of readers. I have not seen anything like it before. It is a book that a physicist or engineer would be proud to have written, and the fact that it has been written by a mathematician only adds to the book's authority. A definite winner."<b>--Paul J. Nahin, author of <i>Digital Dice</i></b></p><p>"I know of no other book quite like this, or even similar to it. After a couple of sentences of the introduction, I was hooked.

One day it seems that everything in life is good, and the next day it can feel like everything is falling apart. Then there are those in between days when we&#x2019;re coasting along without much thought to the highs or lows. The prophet Elijah experienced this rollercoaster ride as well. One moment he was hiding out in the wilderness during a famine, being fed by the ravens, and the next he was on the mountaintop where God showed up in a powerful way with fire and then rain. Even Elijah grew weary of all the ups and downs, telling God, &#x201c;I have had enough&#x201d; (1 Kings 19:4). He needed <em>spiritual stamina</em> in order to keep on going and fulfill all the plans God had for his life. We do too! </p> <p>In this six-week study grounded in 1 and 2 Kings, we will examine the life of the prophet Elijah, an ordinary man who did extraordinary things for God in the midst of the highs and lows of life. We&#x2019;ll learn some of the spiritual stamina secrets that helped him to hold on and persevere in faith, including practical habits related to making decisions, caring for the soul, accepting his circumstances, mentoring, and finishing well&#x2014;which was his ultimate legacy. Whether we&#x2019;re currently in a mountaintop season where we&#x2019;re experiencing God&#x2019;s power and blessing, a valley season where we feel like running away, or somewhere in between, Elijah&#x2019;s life will inspire us to go the distance in the life of faith. Best of all, his story will challenge us but not shame us, because we&#x2019;ll discover that Elijah was just as human as we are. He doubted and struggled just as we do, but ultimately, he chose to believe God. As we study his life, we will grow in faith and develop spiritual stamina that will help us not only to survive but actually thrive in <em>every </em>season.</p> <p>Bible Study Features:</p> <ul> <li>Examine the life of the prophet Elijah.</li> <li>Learn practical disciplines that give us spiritual stamina for every season in life.</li> <li>Grow in faith and be inspired by an ordinary man who did extraordinary things for God.</li> <li>Be enabled to not just survive but thrive in the midst of the ups and downs of life.</li> </ul> <p>The participant workbook, to be used along with the study's DVD, includes five days of lessons for each week, combining study of Scripture with personal reflection, application, and prayer.</p> <p>Other components for the Bible study, available separately, include a Leader Guide, DVD with six sessions of about 25 minutes each, and boxed Leader Kit (an all-inclusive box containing one copy of each of the Bible study&#x2019;s components).

Edith Wharton draws on three centuries of knowledge written in four languages and covers some eighty villas and sixty garden architects. She describes the remarkable splendor of the villas for readers who have never seen them, and leads the reader through her discoveries of why the great houses and grounds create an effect of such profound calm and resolution.Their impact is not merely a matter of ancient statues or splashing fountains&#x2014;impressive as these may be. Rather, the unique harmony stems from the spirit of the architects' and the designers' art: that delicate blending of man's work and the variations of nature to achieve a sense of flawless concord. Her success in describing the Villa D'Este, the Villa Medici, and others, is enhanced and vivified by the breathtaking, full-color paintings of Maxfield Parrish.In his introductory essay, Henry Hope Reed, president of Classical America, places <i>Italian Villas and Their Gardens</i> in the context of American garden design at the turn of the century. Edith Wharton's thesis, that there is much value to be learned from the traditional Italian garden, helped to shape the American landscape of the era. In conveying the message, Maxfield Parrish proved a worthy acolyte. Thomas S. Hayes, who is president of the Edith Whatron Restoration, Inc., tells in his essay how the Italian model guided her in designing the garden of her famous country house, the Mount, at Lenox, Massachusetts.</p><p>Edith Wharton was a Pulitzer Prize-winning American novelist, known for such classics as The House of Mirth, Ethan Frome, and The Age of Innocence, for which she won the Pulitzer Prize in 1921. A member of the New York elite, Wharton drew on her experiences as part of society to critique its inner workings and the conflict between personal desires and societal norms. Wharton died in 1937, leaving behind a rich literary legacy.</p><h2>Here on Earth</h2><p>A middle-aged woman, along with her fifteen-year-old daughter, returns to her small Massachusetts hometown for the funeral of the housekeeper who raised her and finds herself thrust into the lives of the people she left behind. 100,000 first printing. Lit Guild Feat Alt. Tour.</p><p>In this first-rate "tape turner" Hoffman once again proves her powers as a storyteller. Dialogue rings remarkably true in this reading by Susan Ericksen, which also brings out the incisive details and keen observations on nature, both human and otherwise, that Hoffman carefully deploys in this masterful narrative.<p> When March Murray travels East with her teenage daughter to attend the funeral of the beloved housekeeper who looked after her when she was growing up, March's past comes rushing up to meet her. The present is quickly dominated by the lurking presence of her former lover, Hollis, who has patiently awaited her long overdue return. The tale is populated by those for whom love brings more sorrow than happiness: a woman afraid to commit to a relationship, a husband in love with someone other than his wife, two young people who fall for each other only to find they are close relatives, and the self-destructing love of Hollis and March. While love has the power to transform those who fall under its spell--devotion to an old racehorse turns March's daughter, a sullen teenager, into a strong young woman--the love March herself suffers robs her of nearly all sense and goodness. Hoffman deftly weaves her characters' stories against a vivid New England landscape where the past always has a grip on the present. And the listener is left at the end both satisfied and longing to hear more. <i>--Anne Depue</i></p>Alice Hoffman is the bestselling author of nearly twenty acclaimed novels beloved by teens and adults, including Aquamarine and Practical Magic, both made into major motion pictures, as well as The Foretelling, Green Angel, The Ice Queen, and Here on Earth (an Oprah Book Club selection). She has also written the highly praised story collections Local Girls and Blackbird House. The author lives outside of Boston.</p><h2>Practice of Local Government Planning</h2><p>The introductory chapter to the book, with its discussion of planning environments, begins the examination of new developments in the planning field. Each chapter considers, in its turn, the influences that shape current planning practice. For example, in recent years, the shifting role of the federal government has been one of the greatest sources of change. As federal funds for a number of programs have decreased or been withdrawn, local and state governments have had to rethink their services and discover ways to make up the difference. The nature of the planning profession- which is characterized by a long-term perspective-has made planners central to this process. As both administrators and policymaking bodies have come to rely on the breadth of knowledge conferred by planning expertise, planners in numerous municipalities have assumed increasingly important roles in local government-and often find themselves mediating among a number of competing interests and needs. Although this position can be a difficult one for planners who view themselves as neutral technicians, other planners have chosen to become advocates for groups whose needs might otherwise be overlooked.</p><p></p><h2>The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time: A Proposal in Natural Philosophy</h2><p>Cosmology is in crisis. The more we discover, the more puzzling the universe appears to be. How and why are the laws of nature what they are? A philosopher and a physicist, world-renowned for their radical ideas in their fields, argue for a revolution. To keep cosmology scientific, we must replace the old view in which the universe is governed by immutable laws by a new one in which laws evolve. Then we can hope to explain them. The revolution that Roberto Mangabeira Unger and Lee Smolin propose relies on three central ideas. There is only one universe at a time. Time is real: everything in the structure and regularities of nature changes sooner or later. Mathematics, which has trouble with time, is not the oracle of nature and the prophet of science; it is simply a tool with great power and immense limitations. The argument is readily accessible to non-scientists as well as to the physicists and cosmologists whom it challenges.</p><p>Cosmology is in crisis.

It has been identified with totalitarianism, state terror, fanaticism, orchestrated violence, and blind obedience, and was directly associated with the horrors of the Second World War, which left more than 40 million dead and introduced inconceivable notions of inhumanity. The mere mention of the term today evokes visions of atrocities and ineffable cruelty. Yet, the end of the twentieth century appears to have spawned a renewed interest in fascism, suggesting that it is time for us to examine our understanding of its ideas, ideals, and inequities.<br> Edited by Roger Griffin, described as 'the premier theorist {of fascism} of the younger generation' (<em>Contemporary European History</em>), this important Oxford Reader demonstrates why fascism strongly appeals to many people, and how dangerous the result of this fascination may be. It includes a wide selection of texts written by fascist thinkers and propagandists, as well as by prominent anti-fascists from both inside and outside Europe, before and after the Second World War. Included are texts on fascism in Germany and Italy, on the abortive pre-1945 fascisms in more than a dozen countries around the world, on reactions to fascism, and on post-war and contemporary fascism. With contributions from writers as diverse as Benito Mussolini and Primo Levi, Joseph Goebbels and George Orwell, Martin Heidegger and Max Horkheimer, this compelling anthology provides insight into the depths and breadths of the destructive repercussions of fascist ideology. In no other volume will students of political theory, history, sociology, and psychology have access to such a compendium of key texts on this simultaneoulsy intriguing and frightening political force.<br></p><p><br>Roger Griffin is the author of several studies of fascism, including <em>The Nature of Fascism</em> (1991, 1993), and contributor to <em>Contemporary Political Ideologies</em> (1993).

Stewart offers the definitive biography of the father of the Harlem Renaissance, based on the extant primary sources of his life and on interviews with those who knew him personally. He narrates the education of Locke, including his becoming the first African American Rhodes Scholar and earning a PhD in philosophy at Harvard University, and his long career as a professor at Howard University. Locke also received a cosmopolitan, aesthetic education through his travels in continental Europe, where he came to appreciate the beauty of art and experienced a freedom unknown to him in the United States. And yet he became most closely associated with the flowering of Black culture in Jazz Age America and his promotion of the literary and artistic work of African Americans as the quintessential creations of American modernism. In the process he looked to Africa to find the proud and beautiful roots of the race. Shifting the discussion of race from politics and economics to the arts, he helped establish the idea that Black urban communities could be crucibles of creativity. Stewart explores both Locke's professional and private life, including his relationships with his mother, his friends, and his white patrons, as well as his lifelong search for love as a gay man. <br><br>Stewart's thought-provoking biography recreates the worlds of this illustrious, enigmatic man who, in promoting the cultural heritage of Black people, became -- in the process -- a New Negro himself.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jeffrey C. Stewart</strong> is a professor of Black Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He is the author of <em>Paul Robeson: Artist and Citizen </em>and <em>1001 Things Everyone Should Know About African American History</em>.<br><br>"Locke represents a biographical challenge of unusual difficulty. Superbly educated, dazzlingly intelligent, psychologically complicated, and a cultural analyst and visionary whose books and essays helped to shape our understanding of race and modern American culture, Locke could also be petty and vindictive, manipulative and cruel. Also stamping his identity was his brave commitment to living fully as a gay man, despite its various dangers. Jeffrey Stewart, rising superbly to this challenge, has given us one of the finest literary biographies to appear in recent years." - Arnold Rampersad, Stanford University <br><p></p><br>"Jeffrey Stewart's long anticipated biography of the enigmatic Alain Locke fulfills its promise-and then some. It is magnificent! A panoramic portrait of one of the great thinkers, teachers, and literary entrepreneurs of the early twentieth century, <em>The New Negro</em> sheds fresh light on the intellectual firmament whose brightest star discovered African American modernism in an era of cosmopolitanism, colonialism, and catastrophe, and the man whose complex and tragic life left him defeated, unfulfilled, and underappreciated. . . . until now." - Robin D. G. Kelley, author of <em>Thelonious</em> <em>Monk: The Life and Times of an American Original</em> <br><p></p><br>"More than an account of Locke's professional and academic life, Stewart's book offers an integrated vision of Locke's professional and personal life and many details on the innermost aspects of Locke's personal life. This is without question one of the most comprehensive and insightful biographies of an important African American intellectual. Readers will be greatly rewarded for investing their time in its penetrating and revealing pages."- Jacoby Carter, CUNY John Jay College <br><p></p><br>"Stewart creates a poignant portrait of a formidable yet flawed genius who navigated the cultural boundaries and barriers of his time while nurturing an enduring African-American intellectual movement."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em>, Starred Review <br><p></p><br>"A magisterial biography... it brilliantly doubles as a history of the philosophical debates that girded black artistic triumphs early in the 20th century. A sweeping biography that gets deep into not just the man, but the movements he supported, resisted, and inspired."--<em>Kirkus</em>, Starred Review <br><p></p><br>"[A] comprehensive, richly contextualized portrait of a key writer, educator, philosopher, and supporter of the arts."--<em>Booklist</em>, Starred Review <br><p></p><br>"<em>The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke</em> is a vitally important, astonishingly well researched, exhaustive biography of the brilliant, complex, flawed, utterly fascinating man who, if he did not start the movement, served as its curator, intellectual champion, and guiding spirit... It is difficult to imagine a more able chronicler of Alain Locke's singular journey than Mr. Stewart."--<em>Wall Street Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"In describing Locke's life as a black man, a thinker and fighter in social causes, and a homosexual, Stewart... must in a way describe many different Alain Lockes. That such a gripping and cohesive narrative could be forged out of such fractured material is no mean accomplishment... Locke himself was constantly re-inventing in a life that defied easy categorization. Jeffrey Stewart has written the definitive study that life has always warranted - and, fittingly, he's made it excellent reading in the process."--<em>Christian Science Monitor</em> <br><p></p><br>"Majestic... [<em>The New Negro</em> is] a master class in how to trace the lineage of a biographical subject's ideas and predilections. The attachment and longing Locke experienced in relationships with his mother, friends and lovers exerted as much influence on his work as the texts he read and lectures he attended. One finishes Stewart's book haunted by the realization that this must be true for us all."--<em>New York Times Book Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"Locke's achievement--and what is still more fascinating, his complex and contradictory personality--can now be appreciated in full, thanks to a monumental new biography... Drawing extensively on Locke's correspondence and archive, and offering a richly informed portrait of his milieu, <em>The New Negro</em> is a major biography of a kind that even writers more famous than Locke are lucky to receive."--<em>Harvard Magazine</em> <br><p></p><br>"A masterpiece of sustained craft, research, and historical scope."--<em>New York Journal of Books</em> <br><p></p><br>"Stewart's sprawling, magisterial labor of love comes as a reminder that in those <em>Birth of a Nation</em> days a century ago, when race relations were far worse than they are now, a fiercely independent philosopher of color set down visions of black American freedom beyond economic agendas, nationalist visions, and political protest. This book draws Alain Locke out of the shadows and bestows his legacy to artists of all colors and genders seeking freedom from narrow-minded expectations and fear-mongering hypocrisy." <br>--<em>Bookforum</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>The New Negro</em> is a nuanced biography of a complicated, important figure in black and queer cultural history... Those brave enough to plunge in... will find much of interest to take away."--<em>The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Stewart's biography is no mere birth-to-death catalogue of Locke's deeds in life; it is comprised of exquisite intellectual detail that Stewart presents as the defining engine of his subject's development."--<em>Black Perspectives</em><p></p><br>"Jeffrey C. Stewart's comprehensive biography of Locke is a surprisingly gripping read... Locke's life story, beginning as a young black man who was born to a middle-class family in Philadelphia, and who was especially close with his mother, is compelling right from the beginning."--<em>Vox</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Chronicles of Avonlea (L.M.

M. Montgomery has written twelve tales of secret hopes and hidden dreams, filled with enchantment and humor.</p><p>Lucy Maud Montgomery (November 30, 1874 &#x2013; April 24, 1942) published as L.M. Montgomery, was a Canadian author best known for a series of novels beginning in 1908 with Anne of Green Gables. The book was an immediate success. The central character, Anne Shirley, an orphaned girl, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following. The first novel was followed by a series of sequels with Anne as the central character. Montgomery went on to publish 20 novels as well as 530 short stories, 500 poems, and 30 essays.</p><h2>Ruling Planets: Your Astrological Guide to Life&#39;s Ups and Downs</h2><p><p>Centuries ago, a king wouldn't think of going to war without first consulting the planets. A physician, upon hearing that a patient had fallen ill, would immediately check the placement of the planets to diagnose the disease and decide how best to treat it.</p><p>Nowadays, people tend to identify with their zodiac sign rather than with their Planet. Each of us is born under a specific Ruling Planet. Your Ruling Planet is your celestial guide, helping you to navigate your way through life and relationships. Unlike zodiac signs, which are static, planets are in <i>constant motion,</i> changing as you change. Here is the first book to draw on this older and more illuminating tradition. In <i>Ruling Planets</i> Christopher Renstrom shows you how your Ruling Planet plays a collaborative role in nearly every decision you make. It's this active partnership between person and Planet that is missing from today's astrology books.</p><p>The book is divided into four parts. Part I contains the tables you'll need to find your Ruling Planet. All you have to know is the day and year you were born. In Part II, you learn about your Planet's characteristics, temperament, and outlook and how you are, in effect, a "Child" of this Planet. Because not everyone was born at the same time, the zodiac sign that your Ruling Planet was in on your birthday will color certain traits. Part III presents a detailed and personalized view of you, along with favorable-and not so favorable -- times of year. Part IV examines how a Child of one Ruling Planet gets along with a Child of another. These entertaining and thought-provoking insights cover the relationship gamut, from love interests to parents to children to colleagues. Want to know if a relationship has romantic possibilities or if you should just be friends? Check and see which <i>Ruling Planets</i> are involved. What do you do if you got off on the wrong foot with your new boss? A quick glance at his or her Ruling Planet can show you how to finesse a setback into an advance. Ruling Planets will give you a fresh and relevant way of looking at the cosmos and your life.</p><p>Lushly illustrated with full-color art and photos throughout, <i>Ruling Planets</i> also presents a visual tour that winds its way through myth, history, and popular culture. You'll see your Planet's influence in everything from church frescoes to ad campaigns. You'll also meet some famous (and even infamous) Children of your Planet who will make you question familiar assumptions while expanding your point of view.</p><p>Whether you are a die-hard astrology fan or an inquisitive skeptic, <i>Ruling Planets</i> will tickle your curiosity and intrigue your imagination. You will return to it again and again, gleaning new information each time.</p></p><p>Christopher Renstrom is a Child of Saturn. And like other children born under this Planet of tests, he has a penchant for choosing the most difficult route from Point A to Point B. Being accepted to the Juilliard School of Drama at the age of 18 should have put him on the fast track to a successful acting career, but after a year of rehearsing freestyle Afro-Cuban dance combinations and reciting Shakespeare with fellow acting students Kevin Spacey, Val Kilmer, Kelly McGillis, and Elizabeth McGovern, he decided that the actor#146;s life was not for him. He wanted to be a playwright (a quixotic endeavor at best) or an astrologer (the only thing perhaps more quixotic than playwriting.) Luckily Mr. Renstrom has always believed that what#146;s important isn#146;t so much the destination as all the things that happen to you along the way. And in true Child of Saturn fashion, he persevered until obstacles eventually became stepping-stones. <p> Mr. Renstrom was fortunate to train under a principal disciple of the famous strologer Zoltan Mason. After years of intense study he set up practice in 1985. He has worked as a full-time astrologer since. Mr. Renstrom has read for a variety of clients in just about every conceivable situation. He has read horoscopes on ocean liners, in boardrooms, at award ceremonies and hospital rooms. He has fielded questions ranging from the typical about love and money to the atypical like #147;is this a good time for us to go public?#148; and #147;will my military coup be successful?#148; Being an astrologer in New York City has enriched Mr. Renstrom by introducing him to people from all walks of life. For example a Hasidic housewife in Brooklyn does not see the world in the same way as the CEO of a global corporation. Making astrology accessible in diverse contexts is a skill that Mr. Renstrom has refined over time. </p><p> It#146;s this conversational style that has made his astrology columns for <i>Allure </i>magazine, The San Francisco Chronicle (where he replaced Jeanne Dixon), SFGate.com, and the international <i>Renstrom#146;s Horoscopes</i> (available on cell phones and other wireless carriers courtesy of nGame) such a success. Mr. Renstrom has appeared a number of times on Good Morning New York and MSNBC. Also a playwright, four of Mr. Renstrom#146;s five plays have been produced Off Off Broadway. <i>Ruling Planets</i> is his first book.</p></p><h2>The Life Recovery Bible: The 12 Step Bible for People in Recovery</h2><p>A specialty Bible, featuring the entire Living Bible text, designed to introduce readers not only to the source of true wisdom for recovery--God&#39;s Word--but also to the source of power for deliverance--God himself.

Siegel was born in the Bronx in 1947. While living on Jerome Avenue and attending City College of New York (CCNY) in the 1960s, he was swept up in the social and political currents of the time. He became intrigued with the influence contemporary culture had on individual behavior: Did people shape society or did society shape people? He applied his interest in social forces and human behavior to the study of crime and justice. After graduating from CCNY, he attended the criminal justice program at the State University of New York at Albany, earning his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees there.

Now, in <em>The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party</em>, Michael F. Holt gives us the only comprehensive history of the Whigs ever written--a monumental history covering in rich detail the American political landscape from the Age of Jackson to impending disunion.<br> In Michael Holt's hands, the history of the Whig Party becomes a political history of the United States during the tumultuous Antebellum period. He offers a panoramic account of a time when a welter of parties (Whig, Democratic, Anti-Mason, Know Nothing, Free Soil, Republican) and many extraordinary political statesmen (including Andrew Jackson, John C. Calhoun, William Seward, Daniel Webster, Martin Van Buren, and Henry Clay) struggled to control the national agenda as the U.S. inched towards secession. It was an era when Americans were passionately involved in politics, when local concerns drove national policy, and when momentous political events rocked the country, including the Nullification Controversy, the Panic of 1837, the Annexation of Texas, the Compromise of 1850, and the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Holt captures all of this as he shows that, amid this contentious political activity, the Whig Party continuously strove to unite North and South, repeatedly trying to find a compromise position. Indeed, the Whig Party emerges as the nation's last great hope to prevent secession and civil war.<br> <em>The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party</em> is a magisterial work of history, one that has already been hailed by William Gienapp of Harvard as "one of the most important books on nineteenth-century politics ever written."</p><p>Most Americans remember the Whigs as morally uptight New Englanders who provided us with some of our more mediocre presidents. In his exhaustively researched book <i>The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party</i>, Michael F. Holt partially rehabilitates the reputation of this once-thriving political party. Founded in 1833, following Andrew Jackson's decimation of the Second Bank of the United States, the Whigs were united in the belief that the federal government was obligated to sponsor the nation's internal development and to promote manufacturing and large-scale agricultural endeavors. In Holt's account, however, proponents of Whiggery were divided on numerous other issues.<p> The nature of these disagreements amongst party leaders (most notably Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and future presidents such as John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, and Millard Fillmore) take up the majority of space in Holt's 1,200-page account. Instead of relating how general sentiment on major issues (such as territorial expansion and the Compromise of 1850) determined the Whigs' fate, Holt shows how local and statewide political caucuses, party "kingmakers," federal patronage, and special interests created competing factions within the party even before sectionalism fractured cooperation between Northern and Southern wings in 1854. Amidst the diffused levels of power that defined the Federalism of the post-Jacksonian era, Holt concludes that the more popular leaders (such as Taylor and Fillmore) tried to balance competition amongst party factions instead of imposing an ideological "hard line" on sectional issues, a move that alienated many of the party's key ideological supporters. Written in an engaging narrative style with a minimal engagement of abstract theory, <i>The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party</i> meticulously reconstructs the byzantine world of 19th-century American politics. <i>--John M.

"Shell" is the UNIX term for a user interface to the system -- something that lets you communicate with the computer via the keyboard and display. <i>Bash</i>, the Free Software Foundation's "Bourne Again Shell," is the default shell for Linux, the popular free UNIX-like operating system. It's also a replacement for the standard UNIX Bourne shell, which serves both as a user interface and as a programming language. Like the FSF's other tools, <i>bash</i> is more than a mere replacement: it extends the Bourne shell in many ways. Features include command line editing, key bindings, integrated programming features, command completion, control structures (especially the select construct, which enables you to create menus easily), and new ways to customize your environment.Whether you want to use <i>bash</i> for its user interface or its programming features you will find <i>Learning the bash Shell</i> a valuable guide. The book covers all of <i>bash</i>'s features, both for interactive use and programming. If you are new to shell programming, <i>Learning the bash Shell</i> provides an excellent introduction, covering everything from the most basic to the most advanced features, like signal handling and command line processing. If you've been writing shell scripts for years, it offers a great way to find out what the new shell offers. The book is full of examples of shell commands and programs that are designed to be useful in your everyday life as a user, not just to illustrate the feature being explained. All of these examples are freely available to you online on the Internet.This second edition covers all of the features of <i>bash</i> Version 2.0, while still applying to <i>bash</i> Version 1.x. New features include the addition of one-dimensional arrays, parameter expansion, and more pattern-matching operations. <i>bash</i> 2.0 provides even more conformity with POSIX.2 standards, and in POSIX.2 mode is completely POSIX.2 conformant. This second edition covers several new commands, security improvements, additions to ReadLine, improved configuration and installation, and an additional programming aid, the <i>bash</i> shell debugger.With this book you'll learn:</p><ul><li>How to install <i>bash</i> as your login shell</li><li>The basics of interactive shell use, including UNIX file and directory structures, standard I/O, and background jobs</li><li>Command line editing, history substitution, and key bindings</li><li>How to customize your shell environment without programming</li><li>The nuts and bolts of basic shell programming, flow control structures, command-line options and typed variables</li><li>Process handling, from job control to processes, coroutines and subshells</li><li>Debugging techniques, such as trace and verbose modes</li><li>Techniques for implementing system-wide shell customization and features related to system security</li></ul></p><p>Learning the bash Shell is the definitive guide to bash, the Free Software Foundation&#39;s &#34;Bourne Again Shell&#34;. It&#39;s a freely available replacement for the popular UNIX Bourne shell. It is also the shell of choice for Linux users around the world. You&#39;ll find this guide valuable whether you&#39;re interested in bash as a user interface or for its powerful programming capabilities. It will teach you how to use bash&#39;s advanced command-line features, like command history, command-line editing, and command completion. Learning the bash Shell also introduces shell programming, a skill no UNIX or Linux user should be without. The book demonstrates what you can do with bash&#39;s programming features. You&#39;ll learn about flow control, signal handling, and command-line processing and I/O. There is also a chapter on debugging your bash programs. Finally, Learning the bash Shell shows you how to get bash, install it, configure it, and customize it. It also gives advice to system administrators managing bash for their user community.<p>Cameron Newham lives in Perth, Western Australia.

When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway. The couple had three children&#x2014;an older daughter Susanna and twins, Judith and Hamnet. Hamnet, Shakespeare&#x2019;s only son, died in childhood. The bulk of Shakespeare&#x2019;s working life was spent in the theater world of London, where he established himself professionally by the early 1590s. He enjoyed success not only as a playwright and poet, but also as an actor and shareholder in an acting company. Although some think that sometime between 1610 and 1613 Shakespeare retired from the theater and returned home to Stratford, where he died in 1616, others believe that he may have continued to work in London until close to his death.<br><br>Barbara A.

Shocking as this sentence was, it was overturned only after intense international attention and the interference of an embarrassed John Foster Dulles. Soon after the United States' segregated military defeated a racist regime in World War II, American racism was a major concern of U.S. allies, a chief Soviet propaganda theme, and an obstacle to American Cold War goals throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Each lynching harmed foreign relations, and "the Negro problem" became a central issue in every administration from Truman to Johnson.</p><br><p> In what may be the best analysis of how international relations affected any domestic issue, Mary Dudziak interprets postwar civil rights as a Cold War feature. She argues that the Cold War helped facilitate key social reforms, including desegregation. Civil rights activists gained tremendous advantage as the government sought to polish its international image. But improving the nation's reputation did not always require real change. This focus on image rather than substance--combined with constraints on McCarthy-era political activism and the triumph of law-and-order rhetoric--limited the nature and extent of progress.</p><br><p> Archival information, much of it newly available, supports Dudziak's argument that civil rights was Cold War policy. But the story is also one of people: an African-American veteran of World War II lynched in Georgia; an attorney general flooded by civil rights petitions from abroad; the teenagers who desegregated Little Rock's Central High; African diplomats denied restaurant service; black artists living in Europe and supporting the civil rights movement from overseas; conservative politicians viewing desegregation as a communist plot; and civil rights leaders who saw their struggle eclipsed by Vietnam.</p><br><p> Never before has any scholar so directly connected civil rights and the Cold War. Contributing mightily to our understanding of both, Dudziak advances--in clear and lively prose--a new wave of scholarship that corrects isolationist tendencies in American history by applying an international perspective to domestic affairs.</p><br><p> In her new preface, Dudziak discusses the way the Cold War figures into civil rights history, and details this book's origins, as one question about civil rights could not be answered without broadening her research from domestic to international influences on American history.</p></p><p><p>"Meticulously researched and beautifully written, Mary Dudziak's book makes a spectacularly illuminating contribution to a subject traditionally neglected--the linkage between race relations and foreign policy: neither African-American history nor diplomatic history will be the same again."<b>--Gerald Horne, author of <i>Race Woman: The Lives of Shirley Graham Du Bois</i></b></p><p>"Reinhold Niebuhr once commented that blacks cannot count on the altruism of whites for improvements in blacks' condition. Readers who think Niebuhr's remark was unfair to whites need to read this book. Mary Dudziak documents, in impressive detail, how the self-interest of elite whites instigated, shaped, and limited civil rights gains for blacks during the Cold War years. Raises serious questions about the future of racial justice in America."<b>--Richard Delgado, Jean Lindsley Professor of Law, University of Colorado</b></p><p>"This book is a <i>tour de force</i>. Dudziak's brilliant analysis shows that the Cold War had a profound impact on the civil rights movement. Hers is the first book to make this important connection. It is a major contribution to our understanding of both the Civil Rights movement and the Cold War itself. . . . Because it is beautifully written in clear, lively prose, and draws its analysis from dramatic events and compelling stories of people involved from the top level of government to the grass roots, it will be an outstanding book for both students and the general public. I recommend it with no hesitation and with great enthusiasm."<b>--Elaine Tyler May, author of <i>Homeward Bound: American Families in the Cold War Era</i></b></p><p>"This book reflects a growing interest among historians in the global significance of race. . . . It is accessible and will have multiple uses as an approach to civil rights history, as an examination of policy making, and as a model of how a study can be attentive to both foreign and domestic aspects of a particular issue.

Within a century, their descendants were ruling a vast territory that extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indus River valley in modern Pakistan. This region became the arena for a new cultural experiment in which Muslim scholars and creative artists synthesized and reworked the legacy of Rome, Greece, Iran, and India into a new civilization. </p><b><i> </i></b><i></i><p><i><b>A History of the Muslim World to 1405</b></i> traces the development of this civilization from the career of the Prophet Muhammad to the death of the Mongol emperor Timur Lang. Coverage includes the unification of the Dar a1-Islam (the territory ruled by Muslims), the fragmentation into various religious and political groups including the Shi'ite and Sunni, and the series of catastrophes in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries that threatened to destroy the civilization. </p><b> </b><p><b>Features:</b> </p> <p>Balanced coverage of the Muslim world encompassing the region from the Iberian Peninsula to South Asia. </p> <p>Detailed accounts of all cultures including major Shi'ite groups and the Sunni community. </p> <p>Primary sources. </p> <p>Numerous maps and photographs featuring a special four-color art insert. </p> <p>Glossary, charts, and timelines. </p></p><p><p> This book is an introduction to the history of the Muslim world for readers with little or no knowledge of the subject. I use the term <i>Muslim</i> rather than <i>Islamic</i> because this is a study of the history made by the Muslim peoples rather than a history of the religion of Islam: It is important to make a distinction between <i>Muslim</i> and <i>Islamic</i>&#x2014;properly speaking, <i>Islamic</i> should refer to elements of the religion, while <i>Muslim</i> relates to the adherents of the religion. Thus, not all customs followed by Muslims are Islamic, and although a mosque is an example of Islamic architecture, a palace is not. A generation ago, the great scholar Marshall Hodgson wrestled with this problem and coined the term <i>Islamicate</i> to describe the cultural features of Muslim societies that were not strictly religious, such as secular architecture. The term has not gained widespread acceptance, and this oak will avoid it. </p> <p> If the distinction between <i>Islamic</i> and <i>Muslim</i> seems strained, suppose that someone said that the White House is an example of Christian architecture because a Christian designed it, or that Bastille Day is a Christian holiday, since it is celebrated in a country with a Christian majority. No one is tempted to make such assertions, and yet they are equivalent to speaking of <i>Islamic</i> palaces or <i>Islamic medicine,</i> as many historians do. Much of the history related in this book is not directly related to Islam, and so it is more appropriately called Muslim history. </p> <p> The phrase <i>Muslim world,</i> as used in this book, refers to regions ruled by Muslim-dominated governments, as well as areas in which the Muslim population is a majority or an influential minority. For several decades in the seventh century, the Muslim world was coterminous with the region often referred to today as the Middle East, but it soon expanded far beyond that heartland. By the tenth century, many of the most important cultural developments in the Muslim world were taking place outside the Middle East. The size of the Muslim world has alternately expanded and contracted over time, and we will be concerned to see how and why that has happened. </p> <p> The themes of the book are tradition and adaptation. The history of any society is one of the preservation of core values and practices, but also one of adaptation to changing conditions. Muslims follow a religion that is strongly anchored in both scripture and authoritative codes of behavior and are conditioned to adhere closely to the canon of their religious tradition. On the other hand, from the very beginning Of their history, Muslims have found ways to adapt elements of their faith to their culture, as well as to adapt their cultural values and practices to the core of their faith. am is no more of a homogeneous world religion than is Christianity or Judaism. </p> <p> The themes of tradition and adaptation allow us to make sense of some import issues in Muslim history. By being aware of the premium placed on faithfulness the scriptures, we can understand more clearly how Muslims were able to maintain a common sense of identity throughout the wide expanse of the world in which they settled. Further, we can more readily appreciate why Muslims have accepted certain features of alien cultures and rejected others. From the first century of the Islamic calendar, when Muslims were having to decide how to administer a huge majority of non-Muslims in the former Byzantine and Sasanian empires, until today, when many Muslims are concerned about the impact of a secular, global economy on their heritage, the tension between adherence to tradition on the one hand and adaptation to changing conditions on the other has been at the center of Muslim concerns. </p> <p> This book treats economic, political, intellectual, and social developments over a wide area and across many centuries. Of these topics, the intellectual and political developments receive more attention than social and economic history. The study of the social history of the Muslim world is in its infancy. Therefore, it is not possible at this point to write the history of the daily lives of ordinary men and women in large areas of the Muslim world. Economic history tends to stress connections among areas of the world, which is why it is a popular theme in the field of world history. The motif of connections and of global integration that economic history can convey runs throughout this book as a powerful undercurrent. In the first decade of the twenty-first century, however, I am convinced that our awareness of connections in Muslim history needs to be balanced by an awareness of diversity and discontinuities. Troubling stereotypes of Islam and of Muslims loom large in our culture and can be modified only by our becoming aware of the diversity of religious and political expressions within the Muslim world. </p> <p> A widely held assumption in our society is that Islam is a crystallized artifact from the seventh century&#x2014;or, at best, from the tenth or eleventh century, when Islamic law is often said to have stopped developing. It is important to be aware of the important stages in the historical development of Islam and to realize that critical periods in history have encouraged Muslims to be either flexible or inflexible in their reception of new ideas. It is also important to be aware of the varieties of expression of Islam. Many generalizations about Islam are actually applicable only to Sunni Islam, and even then, to the Sunni Islam practiced in certain countries, not to regions in other parts of the world. The history of Shiite Islam is usually ignored&#x2014;or recognized only in passing. Shiites have played a major role in history and should be recognized for having done so. </p> <p> Another widely held stereotype is that Muslims form a monolithic, homogeneous mass that acts in concert on given issues. In recent years, this assumption has given rise to the notion that "Islam" and "the West" are on the eve of a "clash of civilizations." According to this theory, when Muslims in one area have a grievance against "the West," other Muslim groups will come to their aid on the basis of their civilizational "kin." The impression of a monolithic Muslim world is reinforced by the fact that many world history books discuss the Abbasid caliphate (750-1258) as though it were an empire that united the great majority of the world's Muslims of that age, leaving the impression that Muslims have a history of political unity. Even the textbook discussions of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century empires of the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals rarely note their great differences. The fact is that Muslim political unity was shattered in the third decade after the Prophet's death. There have been numerous Muslim political entities ever since then. Not only have conflicting interests divided them, but Muslim states have also frequently allied with Christian, Hindu, or other states against fellow Muslims. </p> <p> Just as intellectuals prior to the seventeenth century thought that the universe possessed different physical properties from those on earth, so have historians and political theorists often treated Muslim history as different in kind from the history of the rest of the world. This book attempts to show through an examination of their history that Muslims are an integral part of the world community and have functioned as other human beings have under similar conditions. </p></p><h2>The Collected Tales of Nikolai Gogol</h2><p>In the first new translation of the Russian writer&#39;s short fiction in twenty-five years, an award-winning pair of translators presents his satirical and fantastic tales of downtrodden characters who are set upon by the powers that be.</p><p>"When, as in his immortal 'The Overcoat,' [Gogol] really let himself go and pottered happily on the brink of his private abyss, he became the greatest artist that Russia has yet produced." <br>--Vladimir NabokovNikolai Gogol was born in the Ukraine in 1809 and died in 1852.

How difficult is it to keep a series like this fresh, both for readers and for yourself?</p> <p><strong>John: </strong>Well, I still enjoy writing the Parker books, which helps a lot! I suppose that I made a few decisions early on which have stood me in good stead. One of those was to let Parker age gradually, so that the nature of the books would change as he changed. I always think of Robert B. Parker's Spenser series: I liked those books a lot, and they were always entertaining at the very least, but Spenser is vaguely ageless, and so the books remain kind of static. By contrast, James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux is now a man in his sixties, and his capacities&#x2014;and his fears&#x2014;are not the same as they were in his youth, which gives both a potency and a sadness to the books. </p> <p>A second decision I made was to have a larger narrative slowly being constructed over the course of the novels. While a reader can start anywhere in the series, by reading in sequence it becomes clear that there is a connecting thread running through them. I suppose it's a little like the difference between the TV crime series of the seventies&#x2014;<i>Columbo</i>, <i>The Rockford Files</i> and their ilk&#x2014;where each episode was entirely self-contained, and modern series like <i>The Wire</i> or <i>The Sopranos</i>, where part of the pleasure lies in watching the story unfold piece by piece. </p> <p>And finally, I take detours to do other books, like <i>The Book of Lost Things</i>, or the <i>Chronicles of the Invaders</i>, or the Samuel Johnson novels, which allows me to exercise some different muscles, and come back to Parker refreshed and maybe with one or two new skills under my belt.</p> <p><strong>Karin: </strong>Like most of the other novels in the series, The Wolf in Winter touches upon the supernatural. There is more of this blurring of the distinctions between genres now than in the past, but is there still an element of resistance to it among more traditional readers and critics?</p> <p><strong>John: </strong> I think a generation of mystery writers has emerged that is perhaps a little more experimental, and more willing to explore the areas of crossover between genres. I love the traditional mystery novel, whether hard-boiled or less explicit, but this doesn't mean that I consider the traditional form as the only way to write mysteries. I've always been curious to explore ideas of justice, compassion and redemption in my books. Because I was raised a Catholic, that word "redemption" comes freighted with a certain amount of spiritual baggage for me. I think it's interesting that the writers I admire a lot&#x2014;James Lee Burke, Michael Connelly, Dennis Lehane&#x2014;are also exploring that notion of redemption through their central characters, and all come from an Irish Catholic background. </p> <p>In the end, though, there remains a pretty conservative rump in mystery fiction which doesn't care much for the mixing of genres, and has a particular loathing for any hint of the supernatural. That harks back to the rationalist roots of the mystery novel, but I've always believed that life, and people, are much odder than an entirely rationalist viewpoint can encompass.</p> <p><strong>Karin: </strong> The novel seems fascinated by the Green Man mythos, which might not be familiar to readers from outside Europe. Where did that come from? </p> <p><strong>John: </strong> A lot of older churches throughout Europe often feature pagan symbolism, particularly faces that appear to be constructed from wood and ivy, and the name given to such depictions in England is "Green Man." I think it was a way for the early Christian Church to acknowledge certain beliefs that were, if not quite pagan, then very much manifestations of the people's connection to the land. Some of them are benevolent, but some of them are quite horrifying. So at the heart of <i>The Wolf in Winter</i> is one of these old churches, transported stone by stone from Northumberland to the United States. And if you bring the church, then you also bring the beliefs...</p> <p><strong>Karin: </strong> What next?</p> <p><strong>John: </strong> I've finished <i>Empire</i>, the second book in the <i>Chronicles of the Invaders</i>, which I'm writing with my better half, Jennie Ridyard. It was easier to write than the first one, I think. Collaboration is difficult for many writers, mainly because writing is, by its nature, quite a solitary profession. I struggled a bit with it for the first novel in the series, <i>Conquest</i>, because I'd become so used to working alone over the course of twenty books. But Jennie's input has made those books better.</p> <p>I'm also pretty close to finishing another Nocturnes collection of short stories and novellas and, as I write this, I'm working on the draft of the next Parker book. I'm going through a phase of being pretty prolific, and I'm making the most of it while I can. After all, who knows how long it will last?</p>John Connolly is the author of the Charlie Parker series of mystery novels, the supernatural collection <i>Nocturnes,</i> the Samuel Johnson Trilogy for younger readers, and (with Jennifer Ridyard) the Chronicles of the Invaders series.

America (or at least the Republican Party)</h2><p>When a <i>National Review</i> colleague teased writer Rod Dreher one day about his visit to the local food co-op to pick up a week&#x2019;s supply of organic vegetables (&#x201c;Ewww, that&#x2019;s so lefty&#x201d;), he started thinking about the ways he and his conservative family lived that put them outside the bounds of conventional Republican politics. Shortly thereafter Dreher wrote an essay about &#x201c;crunchy cons,&#x201d; people whose &#x201c;Small Is Beautiful&#x201d; style of conservative politics often put them at odds with GOP orthodoxy, and sometimes even in the same camp as lefties outside the Democratic mainstream. The response to the article was impassioned: Dreher was deluged by e-mails from conservatives across America&#x2014;everyone from a pro-life vegetarian Buddhist Republican to an NRA staffer with a passion for organic gardening&#x2014;who responded to say, &#x201c;Hey, me too!&#x201d;<br><br>In <i>Crunchy Cons</i>, Dreher reports on the amazing depth and scope of this phenomenon, which is redefining the taxonomy of America&#x2019;s political and cultural landscape. At a time when the Republican party, and the conservative movement in general, is bitterly divided over what it means to be a conservative, Dreher introduces us to people who are pioneering a way back to the future by reclaiming what&#x2019;s best in conservatism&#x2014;people who believe that being a truly committed conservative today means protecting the environment, standing against the depredations of big business, returning to traditional religion, and living out conservative godfather Russell Kirk&#x2019;s teaching that the family is the institution most necessary to preserve.<br><br>In these pages we meet crunchy cons from all over America: a Texas clan of evangelical Christian free-range livestock farmers, the policy director of Republicans for Environmental Protection, homeschooling moms in New York City, an Orthodox Jew who helped start a kosher organic farm in the Berkshires, and an ex-sixties hippie from Alabama who became a devout Catholic without losing his antiestablishment sensibilities.<br><br><i>Crunchy Cons</i> is both a useful primer to living the crunchy con way and a passionate affirmation of those things that give our lives weight and measure. In chapters dedicated to food, religion, consumerism, education, and the environment, Dreher shows how to live in a way that preserves what Kirk called &#x201c;the permanent things,&#x201d; among them faith, family, community, and a legacy of ancient truths. This, says Dreher, is the kind of roots conservatism that more and more Americans want to practice. And in <i>Crunchy Cons</i>, he lets them know how far they are from being alone.<br><b>A Crunchy Con Manifesto</b><br> <br>1.

Big business deserves as much skepticism as big government.<br><br>4. Culture is more important than politics and economics. <br><br>5. A conservatism that does not practice restraint, humility, and good stewardship&#x2014;especially of the natural world&#x2014;is not fundamentally conservative. <br><br>6.

Now, we are the countercultural people. &#x2014;John Buck, Arkansas psychologist and crunchy conservative</i><br><br> A few summers ago, in the <i>National Review</i> offices on the east side of Manhattan, I told my editor that I was leaving work early so I could pick up my family's weekly delivery of fruits and vegetables from the neighborhood organic food co-op to which we belonged.<br><br> "Ewww, that's so lefty," she said, and made the kind of face I'd have expected if I'd informed her I was headed off to hear Peter, Paul and Mary warble at a fund-raiser for cross-dressing El Salvadoran hemp farmers.<br><br> Lefty? Moi? But on the subway home to Brooklyn, I had to admit she was right.<br><br> A taste for organic vegetables is a left-wing cliche, and here I was, a writer for the premier conservative political magazine in the country, leaving my post on the front lines to consort with the liberals in my neighborhood as I filled my rucksack with the most beautiful and delicious broccoli, carrots, greens, and whatnot in the city. What's up with that?<br><br> And come to think of it, what's up with those Birkenstock sandals on my feet? It just about killed me to buy them the summer before, given what Birkenstocks symbolize (you know, patchouli, pot, and ponytails on men). But New Yorkers walk a lot, and my sensible wife persuaded me that durable, comfortable Birks made sense for hot summer sidewalks. She was right. So that's how a pair of hippie shoes found their way onto my right-wing feet, which--alas!--had begun marching to a different beat than many of my conservative chums. Funny, I didn't feel any more liberal.<br><br> The summer before, I had been just like my editor, making fun of my wife's friends from her neighborhood moms' group for going once a week to a local church to pick up their vegetables driven in from farms in rural New York State. Just like liberals, I thought, having to have their politically correct eats. And then one day, one of Julie's friends told her that we could have her family's delivery that week, because they would be out of town. Julie and I were knocked flat by the freshness and intense flavors of the co-op's produce. Who knew cauliflower, the Sansabelt slacks of vegetables, could taste so good? I had always thought of it chiefly as a delivery platform for ranch dip and cheese sauce.<br><br> We were no doubt responding to the just-picked freshness of the produce, not its organic status, but no matter. At some point, I started hearing more about the kind of lives the farmers who supplied us were living, and the values of simplicity, community, and self-reliance they honored. In all candor, these people were probably to the left of Ralph Nader, but they reminded me of the kind of older farmers and gardeners I grew up around in rural southern Louisiana--deeply conservative folks whose last Democratic presidential vote likely went to JFK.<br><br> As city people who nevertheless dislike factory farms, shopping malls, cookie-cutter chain stores, and all the pomps and works of mass consumerism, we admired what the scrappy New York farmers were trying to do. In my Louisiana hometown, some farmers spent the go-go nineties selling their pastures to developers, and the torrent of cash caused McMansions to pop up like toadstools after a summer rain. It's hard to blame folks for cashing in, I suppose, but the community in which I was raised was changing rapidly as economic growth caused it to become a bedroom suburb of Baton Rouge. In their own way, the New York farmers were doing what farmers in my Louisiana birthplace were not: conserving agrarian communal traditions by, to paraphrase William F. Buckley describing the founding mission of the National Review, "standing athwart history yelling Stop!"<br><br> Besides, their produce was vastly superior to what was available in the local supermarket. We didn't mind paying a little extra for food this good. The next summer, we joined the co-op, and Julie got a kick out of picking up our weekly deliveries in her National Review tote bag. When you get to our age, you have precious few opportunities to shock the middle class, so you take them where you find them.<br><br> Now, it had never occurred to me, except in a jokey way, that eating organic vegetables was a political act, but my editor's snarky remark got me to thinking about other ways my family's lifestyle was countercultural, and why, though we were thoroughly conservative in our morals and our politics, we weren't a good fit on either the mainstream left or right.<br><br> Three years earlier, Julie had left a fulfilling position as a magazine editorial assistant to stay at home and raise our young son, Matthew. As much as she loved her job, as useful as that extra paycheck was, and for all the grief she took from other New York women who disdained her for "wasting" her college degree, we both felt strongly that we had a responsibility to our son to put his needs first, as much as we were able.<br><br> Once, when Matthew was still an infant, a kind woman in late middle age stopped us to offer admiring comments about our son. She talked about what a disappointment her son was to her, how she and her husband had put him in an expensive private school, but he had become a pothead and a troublemaker. The poor woman lamented how she fought with her husband over disciplining their son, with the boy's father insisting that kids will be kids, and besides, dear, didn't you and I fool around with drugs back in the day? After all that, she asked Julie and me if we had made plans for Matthew's schooling yet--a perfectly rational question in New York City, where parents put their child's name on private-school waiting lists as soon as the blessed babe is conceived. We replied that we were strongly considering homeschooling. The woman recoiled.<br><br> "Isn't that what right-wing Christians do?" she spluttered.<br><br> The conversation went downhill from there, and we found a way to excuse ourselves as gracefully as we could. A few minutes later, walking home, I remarked to Julie that here was a woman whose heart was broken over what her child had become, and that all the money in the world spent at that posh private school couldn't make up for what permissive parenting and a lax educational environment had done to the boy. Here she was longing for the kind of self-disciplined, responsible son that religiously conservative families tend to produce--but she'd die a thousand deaths before actually making the kind of countercultural sacrifices many such families make for the sake of their children's character and future.<br><br> We didn't want to be like this sad woman. In fairness, there are conservative families who find themselves in the same despairing position, having thought that having the correct attitudes, the best of intentions, and enough income to pay for private school would be sufficient to raise good kids. We heard all the time--and still do--from fellow conservatives who are not shy about telling us that our kids are going to be socially maladroit freaks if we don't put them in school. "What about socialization?" they ask anxiously, to which we reply, "Well, look at youth culture today; do you really want your kids socialized into that?"<br><br> As he got older, Julie started making plans to homeschool little Matthew, and was delighted to discover that there was a small but vibrant homeschooling association in New York City. Unlike homeschooling parents in her native Texas, most of whom do so out of conservative religious conviction, these were primarily secular liberals who had nonetheless concluded that they could do a better job teaching their kids than the schools. In New York, at least, homeschooling was not what right-wing Christians did. Julie was startled to discover that she shared many of the same concerns about primary education with moms whose views on many political issues were diametrically opposed.<br><br> Because our faith is at the center of our lives, and because we believe proper Christian worship should honor both truth and beauty, we committed ourselves to an "ethnic" Catholic church in our neighborhood. The people of Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Church are of Lebanese descent, and speak Arabic in the main. Going there the first few times was an eerie experience, because we naturally associated that language with Islam; it sounded to our untutored American ears like the PLO at prayer.<br><br> Yet these people's ancestors were worshipping Jesus Christ when our European ancestors were still praying to trees. Besides, where it really mattered, we all spoke the same language. It was an Eastern-rite parish, where the aesthetically rich, awe-filled fifth-century liturgy was celebrated partly in Aramaic, the language spoken by Jesus, and the priests were decidedly uninterested in the trendiness. We couldn't take the smarmy, white-bread, middle-class American masses at the Roman-rite parishes around us, where the liturgies were washed out and banal, and the moral and theological grandeur of the historical Christian faith was discarded in favor of a piety that demanded no more of you than that you feel good about yourself. This was a form of Catholic Christianity that demanded more from us, and because of that, it was more rewarding. And it seemed so much more solid than Our Lady of What's Happening Now around the corner, where the priests embarrassed themselves trying to be hip and relevant.<br><br> The key thing is, we didn't become members of Our Lady of Lebanon parish because it sounded like a neat experiment in religious tourism. We did so beca...</p><h2>T.A.Z. the Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism</h2><p>collected broadsheets of ontological anarchism</p><p>"Chaos never died," declares this collection of post-postmodern "broadsheets of ontological anarchism." "They lied to you, sold you ideas of good and evil, gave you distrust of your body and shame for your prophethood of chaos, invented words of disgust for your molecular love, mesmerized you with inattention, bored you with civilization and all its usurious emotions." Hakim Bey's calls for a response rooted in "poetic terrorism" are definitely not for the philosophically staid or squeamish, advocating "black magic as revolutionary action" and "a congress of weird religions." But his elaboration of the idea of the Temporary Autonomous Zone, intentional communities that live outside the law, offers a captivating notion of hedonist radicalism for the eve of the 21st century. <i>T.A.Z.</i> is provocative, at times obscene, but it also proves that the avant-garde can entertain as well as challenge. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p><h2>The New Greek-English Interlinear New Testament (Personal Size)</h2><p><i>The New Greek-English Interlinear New Testament</i> contains a literal word-for-word English rendering of the Greek text in interlinear form.

And though the 12-step program by itself can often bring initial success, many addicts find themselves relapsing back into old ways and old patterns, or replacing one addiction with another.<br> <br> Working with the traditional 12-Step philosophy, the author first shares his own life path, and how he came to find the spiritual solace that has greatly enhanced his life in recovery. Then, he details out how his work integrating Buddhism into the traditional twelve-step programs validates both aspects of the recovery process. While being careful not to present himself as a Tibetan lama or Zen master, the author shows how each step -- such as admitting there is a problem, seeking help, engaging in a thorough self-examination, making amends for harm done, and helping other drug addicts who want to recover -- fits into the Bodhisattva path. This integration makes Buddhism accessible for addicts, and the 12 Steps understandable for Buddhists who may otherwise be at a loss to help those in need.<br> <br> <i>The 12-Step Buddhist</i> is designed to be a complimentary practice to the traditional 12-step journey, not a replacement. While traditional twelve-step programs help addicts become sober by removing the drug of choice and providing a spiritual path, they rarely delve deep into what causes people to suffer in the first place. The integration of Buddhism with the traditional process provides the wisdom and meditations that can help addicts truly find a deep, spiritual liberation from all causes and conditions of suffering -- for good.</p><p>Darren Littlejohn dropped out of school in the eighth grade in order to &#x201c;pursue drugs and alcohol as a full-time endeavor.&#x201d; After a long, rough road to sobriety, he passed his high school proficiency exam and went on to earn an AA in Behavior Science from San Jose City College, a BA in Psychology from California State University, Long Beach, and has completed all coursework but the final theses for the MA Pre-Doctoral Research Program, also at the Long Beach campus of California State University. In his personal journey, he studied Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, later integrating all of his life experience, beliefs, credentials and true passion into his work."<i>The 12-Step Buddhist</i> is one of those rare books that transcends genres by seamlessly integrating the 12-step approach, Buddhist principles, and a compelling personal struggle with addiction and a quest for spiritual awakening." -- Donald Altman, M.A., LPC, author of <i>Living Kindness</i> and <i>Meal by Meal</i><br><br>"<i>The 12-Step Buddhist</i> is a unique synthesis of the traditional 12-Step model and the liberating wisdom of Dharma....This personal presentation of the tools Littlejohn used to find his own liberation from addiction is certainly never boring, and well worth reading." -- <i>Mandala Magazine</i><br><br>"This book is written not based on theory or assumption, but by a person who actually went through the experience of recovery and from that experience has seen the benefits of this system as a way to help other people who are facing the same circumstances. This will be an important contribution to the literature of Buddhism and of recovery in the West." -- Yangsi Rinpoche, Tibetan Buddhist teacher and president of Maitripa Institute<br><br>"If the 12-Step program leads to recovery, Buddhist practice and philosophy can provide the spiritual underpinnings needed to stabilize that recovery. [Darren Littlejohn's] interpretation of the 12 Steps as seen through the lens of this wisdom tradition is fascinating and useful.

Patriots celebrated their departure and the confirmation of U.S. independence. But for tens of thousands of American loyalists, the British evacuation spelled worry, not jubilation. What would happen to them in the new United States? Would they and their families be safe? Facing grave doubts about their futures, some sixty thousand loyalists&#x2014;one in forty members of the American population&#x2014;decided to leave their homes and become refugees elsewhere in the British Empire. They sailed for Britain, for Canada, for Jamaica, and for the Bahamas; some ventured as far as Sierra Leone and India. Wherever they went, the voyage out of America was a fresh beginning, and it carried them into a dynamic if uncertain new world.<br><br>A groundbreaking history of the revolutionary era, <i>Liberty&#x2019;s Exiles</i> tells the story of this remarkable global diaspora. Through painstaking archival research and vivid storytelling, award-winning historian Maya Jasanoff re-creates the journeys of ordinary individuals whose lives were overturned by extraordinary events. She tells of refugees like Elizabeth Johnston, a young mother from Georgia, who spent nearly thirty years as a migrant, searching for a home in Britain, Jamaica, and Canada. And of David George, a black preacher born into slavery, who found freedom and faith in the British Empire, and eventually led his followers to seek a new Jerusalem in Sierra Leone. Mohawk leader Joseph Brant resettled his people under British protection in Ontario, while the adventurer William Augustus Bowles tried to shape a loyalist Creek state in Florida. For all these people and more, it was the British Empire&#x2014;not the United States&#x2014;that held the promise of &#x201c;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#x201d; Yet as they dispersed across the empire, the loyalists also carried things from their former homes, revealing an enduring American influence on the wider British world.<br><br>Ambitious, original, and personality-filled, <i>Liberty&#x2019;s Exiles</i> is at once an intimate narrative history and a provocative new analysis&#x2014;a book that explores an unknown dimension of America&#x2019;s founding to illuminate the meanings of liberty itself.<i><br></i></p><p><b>Maya Jasanoff</b>&nbsp;is the Coolidge Professor of History at Harvard.

It was the summer of 1775, the twenty-five-year-old&#x2019;s first on his own American land. He had arrived in the colonies a year earlier from the blustery English port of Whitby, with seventy-four indentured servants in tow, to start a plantation in the Georgia backcountry, near Augusta. The newcomers must have marveled on reaching this strange, subtropical landscape, where giant black oaks stood like sixty-foot columns holding up the sky. Within nine months, Brown and his laborers had cut much of the forest into farms. He supervised his burgeoning 5,600-acre estate from a fine new great house, his tenants surrounding him in thirty-six farmhouses of their own. Horses filled Brown&#x2019;s stables; cattle and hogs got fat off his grass and feed. He applied to the governor for more land, sent away to Britain for another shipload of workers, and enjoyed &#x201c;the pleasing prospect to observe that his affairs in that country were likely to succeed beyond his most sanguine expectations.&#x201d; But another force was set to transform Thomas Brown&#x2019;s new world. He saw it coming one August day in the form of 130 armed men marching straight toward his house.<br>&nbsp;<br>Brown knew, before coming to America, of the &#x201c;troubles&#x201d; that had been tearing up Anglo-American relations for a decade. A series of taxes imposed by Britain had triggered a heated conflict over the limits of parliamentary authority and the rights of colonial British subjects. Brown confidently reckoned that Georgia, a thousand miles away from New England, the center of unrest, had &#x201c;no connection or concern&#x201d; in such affairs. Even in 1774,investing his personal fortune and future in the American colonies looked like a good bet. But in April 1775, British and American troops exchanged the first shots of the revolution outside Boston&#x2014;and no part of the colonies remained unconcerned for long. In Savannah and Charleston, the nearest major cities to Brown&#x2019;s estate, patriots formed associations to organize support for the rebellion, and approached Brown and his neighbors to join. Did he have anything to gain by doing so? Not really. The fact that he had recently arrived&#x2014;and in1775, 10 percent of the colonies&#x2019; white population had immigrated within the last fifteen years&#x2014;mattered less to his calculations than that he intended to spend the rest of his life in the colonies. He owed his land and status to the patronage of the Georgia governor; he also held a position as a local magistrate. Besides, he figured, surely this provincial uprising had little chance of success when met with the full military might of the British Empire. Whatever he may have thought of the principles at stake, self-interest alone pointed out Brown&#x2019;s choice. He refused patriot overtures, and signed on to a loyalist counterassociation instead. The next thing Brown knew, patriot invitations became demands, delivered by gangs like the one at his door.<br>&nbsp;<br>Standing on the porch, the sticky heat clinging to him like a second shirt, Brown tried to put the men off calmly. He had no wish to fight his own neighbors, he said, but he &#x201c;could never enter into an Engagement to take up arms against the Country which gave him being.&#x201d; The conversation quickly turned to confrontation. Some of the patriots &#x201c;threatened that unless he would subscribe the association they would drag him by force to Augusta.&#x201d; Brown backed into the house to seize his weapons, &#x201c;determined to defend himself as long as he was able against any violence.&#x201d; &#x201c;It would be at the peril of that man who should attempt it!&#x201d; he declared, brandishing his pistols. Six men lunged at him. Blades flashed, a gun fired, a rifle butt swung up over his head&#x2014;and smashed squarely down onto his skull. Then blackness.<br>&nbsp;<br>What came next he would reconstruct later, from flashes of recollection in a semiconscious haze. Shattered head throbbing, body bleeding, he rattles over a track. They reach Augusta. He is tossed to the ground, his arms lashed around the trunk of a tree. He sees his bare legs splayed out in front of him, funny-looking foreign things, and he sees hot brown pitch poured over them, scalding, clinging to his skin. Under his feet the men pile up kindling and set it alight. The flame catches the tar, sears his flesh. His feet are on fire, two of his toes charred into stubs. The attackers seize his broken head by the hair and pull it out in clumps. Knives take care of the rest, cutting off strips of scalp, making the blood run down over his ears, face, and neck. Half scalped, skull fractured, lamed, slashed, and battered, Brown&#x2014;remarkably&#x2014;survives. Later, a doctor comes to the place where he is confined and bandages him up, setting his broken bones on course to heal. A sympathetic guard, moved by the spectacle of this badly damaged man, agrees to let Brown get away. He slips out of custody and rides over the border into South Carolina to take shelter with a loyalist friend.<br>&nbsp;<br>In years to come Brown frequently recalled how the patriots &#x201c;tortured him in the most inhuman manner.&#x201d; He did not choose to describe how he was then carted through the streets of Augusta for public mockery&#x2014;and how he, like many victims of such assaults, ultimately broke down and agreed to sign the association (an action he promptly renounced after his escape). But the personal humiliation of giving in to his attackers could only have contributed to the passion of Brown&#x2019;s response. The incident turned him from a noncombatant into a militant enemy of the revolution. Within a matter of weeks, his feet so badly injured he could not walk, his head still wrapped in bandages, Brown rallied hundreds of backcountry residents to form a loyalist militia, the King&#x2019;s Rangers, and fight back. Physically and mentally brutalized by the patriots, Brown in turn earned notoriety as a particularly ruthless, vindictive loyalist commander.<br>&nbsp;<br>A rich historical tradition has portrayed the American Revolution first and foremost as a war of ideals&#x2014;not a war of ordeals. Yet for Brown and thousands more civilians caught in the conflict, this was what the revolution looked like: mobs on the march, neighbors turned enemies, critical decisions forced under stress. As the revolution gathered momentum across the colonies, one American after another faced a choice. Would they join the rebellion or stay loyal to the king and empire? Their answers had to do with a host of factors, including core values and beliefs, self-interest, local circumstance, and personal relationships. But no matter how contingent, their responses could have unexpectedly far-ranging results.<br>&nbsp;<br>What was a loyalist, and what kind of America and British Empire did loyalists want? It is important to note at the outset that, as fellow American colonists, loyalists and patriots had more in common with one another than they did with metropolitan Britons. Both loyalists and patriots shared preoccupations with access to land, the maintenance of slavery, and regulation of colonial trade. Nor did their places of origin necessarily serve as a leading indicator of political difference. While Thomas Brown remained loyal, for instance, one of the indentured servants he brought from the Orkney Islands promptly ran&nbsp;off and joined a patriot militia. Ultimately choices about loyalty depended more on employers, occupations, profits, land, faith, family, and friendships than on any implicit identification as an American or a Briton. At the start of the war, colonists often saw themselves both as American, in the sense that they were colonial residents, and as British, in the sense of being British subjects.<br>&nbsp;<br>What truly divided colonial Americans into loyalists and patriots was the mounting pressure of revolutionary events: threats, violence, the imposition of oaths, and ultimately war. By 1776, the patriots renounced the king&#x2019;s authority, and developed fresh political and philosophical justifications for doing so&#x2014;whereas loyalists wanted to remain British subjects, and wanted the thirteen colonies to remain part of the British Empire. On these fundamental points, loyalists could largely agree. Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to think loyalists were ideologically uniform&#x2014;or that they simply wanted to preserve the status quo. In fact, many leading loyalists sought to reform the imperial relationship. They resisted the prospect of authoritarian rule, and were quick to defend their rights to representation. Indeed, during the colonial protests of the 1760s and 1770s, future loyalists and patriots alike spoke out in unison against perceived British tyranny. They tended to share provincial perspectives on rights and liberties, and a common language of grievance against the abuse of imperial authority. This would have important repercussions in the postwar years, when loyalist refugees found their expectations as British subjects to be at odds with those of their metropolitan British rulers.<br>&nbsp;<br>The troubles in the colonies all started, strangely enough, with Britain&#x2019;s greatest imperial victory. Triumph in the Seven Years&#x2019; War in1763 brought the empire French Canada, Spanish Florida, valuable Caribbean islands, and an important foothold in India. But Britain had also racked up an enormous debt. To offset the costs, Parliament passed a series of measures in the colonies designed to promote imperial security and prosperity. Instead, it unintentionally provoked colonial resistance. Most notoriously, the Stamp Act of 1765, a seemingly innocuous tax on paper products, spectacularly backfired when Americans (and many Britons) denounced it as an abuse of imperial power, imposed by a parliament that did not adequately represent colonists. Many future loyalists were vocal opponents of the Stamp Act, though these protests also saw the first systematic attacks against American &#x201c;tories,&#x201d; suspected of wanting to enhance royal and aristocratic power. Street gangs like the self-described Sons of Liberty smashed property and assaulted individuals&#x2014;most vividly by tarring and feathering, a new hallmark of patriot justice.<br>&nbsp;<br>Violence was a familiar colonial phenomenon by the time a1773 tax on tea touched off the worst trouble yet. One December night, Boston&#x2019;s Sons of Liberty, their faces streaked to resemble Indian warriors, stormed onto British tea ships anchored in Boston harbor and tipped the valuable cargo overboard. Parliament responded by passing the so-called Coercive Acts, closing the port of Boston and demanding repayment for the tea. Americans swiftly branded these the &#x201c;Intolerable Acts.&#x201d; Delegates from around the thirteen colonies decided to convene a continental congress in Philadelphia and develop a coordinated response.<br>&nbsp;<br>A few congressmen arrived in Philadelphia in September 1774already primed for war. They must have cheered enthusiastically at a congressional dinner when the radical pamphleteer Thomas Paine&#x2014;who had recently arrived from England to throw his support behind the patriot cause&#x2014;raised a toast, declaring, &#x201c;May the collision of British Flint and American Steel produce that spark of liberty which shall illumine . . . posterity&#x201d;! But the majority of delegates would have cheered more comfortably when the company drank to the &#x201c;Union of Britain and the Colonies on a constitutional foundation.&#x201d; The prospect of war seemed to most congressmen an unnecessary, not to say suicidal, extreme. Far preferable was finding a way to assert colonial rights and liberties while remaining within the imperial fold.<br>&nbsp;<br>The speaker of the Pennsylvania assembly, Joseph Galloway, offered Congress a compelling plan to achieve this. Galloway agreed with most of his colleagues that the colonies&#x2014;while they held &#x201c;in abhorrence the idea of being considered independent&#x201d;&#x2014;could not adequately &#x201c;be represented in the Parliament of Great Britain.&#x201d; Instead, Galloway suggested that America have a parliament of its own: a &#x201c;Grand Council,&#x201d; to be headed by a president general. Made up of representatives from each colony, this American parliament would &#x201c;hold and exercise all the legislative rights, powers, and authorities&#x201d; required for running colonial affairs. It would also have the power to veto any legislation bearing on America produced by the British parliament. The colonies would thereby enjoy domestic self-government while retaining the benefits of imperial trade and protection. Such a &#x201c;Plan of Union,&#x201d; Galloway argued, was the only way forward if the colonies wanted to stave off &#x201c;all the horrors of a civil war&#x201d; and the inevitable &#x201c;ruin of America.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Galloway&#x2019;s plan was the most significant colonial reform project on the eve of the revolution, though it did not come out of a vacuum. Galloway&#x2019;s mentor Benjamin Franklin had proposed a very similar idea himself twenty years earlier (developed with the governor of Massachusetts Thomas Hutchinson, later reviled as a &#x201c;tory&#x201d;), the Albany Plan of Union of 1754.&#x201c;Join, or Die,&#x201d; Franklin had inscribed under a memorable political cartoon showing the colonies as segments of a cut-up serpent&#x2014;indicating the importance of continental union to American prosperity. Galloway sent his own plan of union to Franklin, then living in London, who circulated the scheme among high-ranking British officials; Franklin&#x2019;s only objection was that it might embroil America in too many British imperial wars. Franklin&#x2019;s son William, the governor of New Jersey, wholeheartedly endorsed it. After all, it had much to commend it to American sensibilities. By granting the colonies control over virtually everything but the ability to go to war, Galloway&#x2019;s plan proposed a greater degree of autonomy for the American colonies than any other British domain enjoyed, including Scotland. His proposed American legislature would have fewer constraints than the Irish parliament, too. Most important, Galloway argued, his plan would aid the development of America itself. If the colonies were going to continue to grow and flourish, there had to be some overarching authority binding them together, in the spirit of Franklin&#x2019;s &#x201c;Join, or Die&#x201d;; perhaps, he suggested, an &#x201c;American constitution.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>For one long late-September day in 1774, Congress debated Galloway&#x2019;s plan of union. The New York delegation was particularly well disposed toward it, with the respected lawyer John Jay speaking out clearly in its favor. It was &#x201c;almost a perfect plan,&#x201d; declared an upstanding young South Carolina planter. Galloway congratulated himself that &#x201c;all the men of property, and many of the ablest speakers, supported the motion.&#x201d; But not all his colleagues were convinced. &#x201c;We are not to consent by the representatives of representatives,&#x201d; insisted Patrick Henry of Virginia. Samuel Adams, the founder of the Sons of Liberty, believed the colonies would do better by withdrawing from the British Empire altogether. When Galloway&#x2019;s plan came to a vote, five colonies voted in its favor versus six against&#x2014;and the plan was tabled. Instead of moving toward closer union with Britain, Congress issued a set of resolutions asserting Americans&#x2019; entitlement to &#x201c;all the rights, liberties, and immunities&#x201d; of British subjects, in terms anticipating those of the Declaration of Independence.<br>&nbsp;<br>The closeness of the vote on Galloway&#x2019;s plan poses an intriguing &#x201c;what if&#x201d; for historians.

Miller is a motivational primer aimed at purging the "blame, complaining, and procrastination" from the workplace. Miller believes that one of the hallmarks of today's business culture is a lack of personal accountability; he prescribes the cure in this series of short stories and personal observations drawn from his years of experience running his organizational development firm. His main point is that positive change begins with individuals changing themselves: "Instead of asking, 'When will others walk their talk?' let's walk our talk first." The result is choppy (39 chapters in 115 pages), and at times Miller's advice boils down to truism and clich�. Nevertheless, managers whose workplaces demand remedial, straightforward advice should find a useful tool here. <i>--Harry C. Edwards</i>The lack of personal accountability is a problem that has resulted in an epidemic of blame, complaining, and procrastination. No organization-or individual-can achieve goals, compete in the marketplace, fulfill a vision, or develop people and teams without personal accountability. <br><br> John G. Miller believes that pointing fingers and blaming others cannot solve the troubles that plague organizations. Rather, the real solutions are found when each of us recognizes the power of personal accountability. In <i>QBQ! The Question Behind the Question</i>, Miller explains how negative, inappropriate questions like "Why do we have to go through all this change?" and "Who dropped the ball?" represent a lack of personal accountability. Conversely, when we ask better questions-QBQs-such as "What can I do to contribute?" or "How can I help solve the problem?" our lives and our organizations are transformed. <br><br> The QBQ!

If this young man&#x2019;s expression was troubled, we may grant he had good cause. More than an hour had elapsed since he had last seen a living soul. Soon it would be dusk, and if he was caught out of doors after curfew he risked a night in jail.</p><p>He had stopped to ask directions in the market town of Axford, where a group of �rough-�looking fellows had been drinking outside an inn beneath the painted sign of a swan. After grinning between themselves at the strangeness of his accent, and imitating the refinement of his <i>yeses</i> and <i>yous,</i> they had assured him that to reach his destination all he needed to do was to ride straight towards the setting sun. But now he was beginning to suspect this might have been another piece of local mischief, for no sooner had he passed the high walls of the town&#x2019;s prison, where three executed felons hung rotting from their gibbets, and crossed the river and entered open country than heavy clouds had blown across the western sky, obliterating the sunset. Behind him the tall spire of Axford&#x2019;s church had long since submerged below the horizon. Ahead, the road twisted and dipped between unpopulated ridges of dark woodland and stretches of wild heath daubed with streaks of yellow gorse before dwindling into the murk.</p><p>Presently, in the way that often in those parts signals a change in the weather, it became very still. All the birds went quiet, even the huge red kites with their incongruous �high-�pitched cries that had pursued him for miles. Chilly veils of sodden grey mist drifted across the moor and draped themselves around him, and for the first time since he set off early that morning he felt moved to pray aloud for protection to his name saint, who had borne the infant Christ on his back across the river.</p><p>After a while, the road began to ascend a wooded hillside. As it climbed, so it dwindled, until it was little better than a cart �track&#x2014;ridged brown earth covered loosely by stones, shards of soft blue slate and yellow gravel braided by the running rainwater. From the steep banks on either side rose the scent of wild �herbs&#x2014;lungwort, lemon balm, mustard �garlic&#x2014;while the overhanging branches drooped so low he had to duck and fend them off with his arm, dislodging further showers of fresh cold water that drenched his head and trickled down his sleeve. Something shrieked and flashed emerald in the gloom, and his heart seemed to jump halfway up his throat, even though he realised almost at once that it was nothing more sinister than a common parakeet. He shut his eyes in relief.</p><p>When he opened them again, he saw a brownish object up ahead. At first he mistook it for a fallen tree. He wiped his sleeve across his face and leaned forward in his saddle. A figure in a hessian smock, cowled like a monk, was pushing a handcart. He dug his knees into the flanks of his mount and urged her on. &#x201c;God be with you!&#x201d; he shouted down at the curious apparition. &#x201c;I am a stranger here.&#x201d;</p><p>The figure pushed ahead even harder, pretending not to have heard, so that he was obliged to pass it once again. This time he wheeled around to block the narrow lane. He noticed the cart was piled with wool bales. He loosened the neck strings of his cape. &#x201c;I mean you no harm. Christopher Fairfax is my name.&#x201d; He pulled down the wet fabric and lifted his beard to show the white cloth tied around his neck. &#x201c;I am a man of God.&#x201d;</p><p>A damp thin male face squinted up at him through the rain. Slowly and reluctantly the hood was drawn back to reveal a head entirely bald. Water ran off the shiny dome, upon the crown of which curved a �blood-�coloured �crescent-�shaped birthmark.</p><p>&#x201c;Is this the road to Addicott St. George?&#x201d;</p><p>The man scratched at his birthmark and screwed up his eyes as if making a great effort of memory. Eventually he said, &#x201c;Ye means <i>Adcut</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>Fairfax&#x2014;dripping water, losing �patience&#x2014;answered, &#x201c;Yes, very well, �then&#x2014;<i>Adcut.</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. There&#x2019;s a fork, a �half-�mile back. Ye needs t&#x2019;take t&#x2019;other.&#x201d; The man looked him up and down. A knowing expression crept across his �face&#x2014;a slow, rural slyness, as if he were measuring a beast at market. &#x201c;Ye&#x2019;re young for the work.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And yet old enough, I think!&#x201d; Fairfax forced a smile and bowed. &#x201c;Peace be upon you.&#x201d;</p><p>He tugged at the bridle and turned his elderly grey mare around, riding her carefully back down the watery track until he found the place where the road forked. It was almost impossible to spot unless one had been warned to look for it. So those wretches in Axford had indeed been trying to get him �lost&#x2014;a trick they&#x2019;d never have dared attempt had they known he was a priest. He ought to tell the local sheriffs. Yes, on his way home he would do exactly that. He would bring the whole weight of the law down upon their stupid rustic �numbskulls&#x2014;imprisonment, a fine, a day in the stocks being pelted by stones and shit&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;.</p><p>This second track was even steeper. Ancient trees on either side, already in full leaf, leaned in no more than a couple of yards above his head as if to confer. Their entwined branches shut out the light. Inside this dank tunnel night seemed already to have fallen. His horse skittered and refused to carry him further. He wrapped his arms around her neck and whispered in her ear, &#x201c;Come on, May!&#x201d; But she was a grumpy beast, stubborn with age, more mule than horse, and in the end he had to dismount and lead her.</p><p>On foot, he felt even more vulnerable. He had twenty pounds in his purse for expenses, counted out a coin at a time by the Dean the previous evening, and many were the travellers who had been murdered for half as much. His boots slithered in the mud as he dragged at the bridle. Oh, but this was a fine joke, he thought bitterly. The bishop might rarely smile, but that did not mean he entirely lacked a certain sense of humour. To send a man off thirty miles, to the furthest edge of the diocese, on such an errand, and on a �clapped-�out horse&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;.</p><p>He pictured his colleagues gathering for their customary early �supper&#x2014;seated on the long benches in the chapter house in front of the huge fire, the bishop bowing his narrow grizzled head to say grace, his face in the blaze still the colour of an oyster, a flicker of malicious merriment in those small dark eyes. &#x201c;And lastly we pray for our brother in Christ, Christopher Fairfax, serving our holy mother the Church tonight&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;. <i>in a �far-�off land</i>!&#x201d;</p><p>Some wretched nearby brook seemed to gurgle with laughter.</p><p>But then, just as he was despairing, a pale glow appeared at the end of the overgrown �lane and after a few more minutes of weary dragging, he emerged into what was left of the day&#x2019;s light to discover himself on the crest of a hill. To his right the land fell away sharply. Small fields with low �dry-�stone walls enclosed a scattering of cows, sheep and goats. Ramshackle wooden stalls had been weathered by the winter to the colour of pewter. At the bottom of the valley, about a mile distant, was a river with a bridge. Next to it, a small settlement of mostly thatched roofs was centred around a square stone church tower. Here and there, feathery lines of �white-�grey smoke rose and bled into the darker grey of the sky. The clouds above the enclosing hills were low and racing, like waves fleeing a storm out at sea. It had stopped raining. He fancied he could smell the chimneys. He imagined light, warmth, company, food. In the wet fresh evening air his spirits revived. Even May&#x2019;s mood improved sufficiently that she consented to let him remount her.</p><p>It was nearly dark by the time they trotted into the centre of the village. May&#x2019;s shod hooves clattered over the arched stone bridge that spanned the river and splashed along the muddy narrow street. His high vantage point enabled him to peer into the whitewashed cottages on either side. Some had small front gardens with white wooden fences. Most opened directly on to the road. In a couple of windows, candles glowed; in one, he glimpsed the full pale moon of a face, quickly eclipsed by a curtain. He halted at the lychgate and looked about him. A cobbled path led through the graveyard to the portico of a church that he guessed must have stood square on this land for at least a thousand years; more likely fifteen hundred. Wrapped around the middle of the flagpole on the top of the tower, the red and white standard of England and St. George hung damply at �half-�mast.</p><p>On the far side of the graveyard, beyond the wall, was a tumbling �two-�storey building with a thatched roof. On the threshold, now that he looked more closely, he could just make out the gaunt figure of a woman dressed in black, holding a lantern, watching him. For a few moments they regarded one another across the lichened tombstones. Then she lifted the light a little and moved it back and forth. He raised his hand, spurred the mare and rode around the perimeter of the churchyard towards the waiting figure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Father Fairfax makes the acquaintance of Father Thomas Lacy</p><p><br><br>She took him upstairs to see Father Lacy right away. He barely had time to lay down his bag in the passage, shed his dripping cape and pull off his muddy boots before he was following her, stiff and �bowlegged from his hours in the saddle, up the narrow wooden staircase to the landing.</p><p>Over her shoulder she informed him that she was Mrs. Agnes Budd, housekeeper, and that she had been watching out for him all day. Beneath her deference he detected an undertone of reproach.</p><p>He had to dip his head to pass through the low doorway. The bedchamber was cold and smelled of chloride of lime. The window was open wide to the bluish dusk; on the floorboards beneath its leaded panes, the rain had puddled. A black coffin lid was propped against a chest of drawers. The coffin itself was on the bed. Candles stood on the nightstands on either side of the heavy wooden bed frame, along with a book and a pair of spectacles, as if the dead man had just finished reading. The flames of the candles flickered in the draught.</p><p>Cautiously he approached the coffin and peered down. The corpse was long and thin, packed in sawdust and bound up tight in a papery white linen shroud, like a chrysalis ready to hatch. A white lace handkerchief covered the face. He glanced at the housekeeper. She nodded. He took the two upper corners of the handkerchief between his thumbs and forefingers and lifted it away.</p></p><h2>Engineer to Win (Motorbooks Workshop)</h2><p>Current state of the art in racing technology by a foremost expert in the field.

Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. That's what it felt like for Keats in 1819. How about Autumn 2016? Daniel is a century old. Elisabeth, born in 1984, has her eye on the future. The United Kingdom is in pieces, divided by a historic, once-in-a-generation summer. Love is won, love is lost. Hope is hand-in-hand with hopelessness. The seasons roll round, as ever. <br><br>Ali Smith's new novel is a meditation on a world growing ever more bordered and exclusive, on what richness and worth are, on what harvest means.

That&#x2019;s the thing about things. They fall apart, always have, always will, it&#x2019;s in their nature. So an old old man washes up on a shore. He looks like a punctured football with its stitching split, the leather kind that people kicked a hundred years ago. The sea&#x2019;s been rough. It has taken the shirt off his back; naked as the day I was born are the words in the head he moves on its neck, but it hurts to. So try not to move the head. What&#x2019;s this in his mouth, grit? it&#x2019;s sand, it&#x2019;s under his tongue, he can feel it, he can hear it grinding when his teeth move against each other, singing its sand-song: I&#x2019;m ground so small, but in the end I&#x2019;m all, I&#x2019;m softer if I&#x2019;m underneath you when you fall, in sun I glitter, wind heaps me over litter, put a message in a bottle, throw the bottle in the sea, the bottle&#x2019;s made of me, I&#x2019;m the hardest grain to harvest<br>&nbsp;<br>to harvest<br>&nbsp;<br>the words for the song trickle away. He is tired. The sand in his mouth and his eyes is the last of the grains in the neck of the sandglass.<br>&nbsp;<br>Daniel Gluck, your luck&#x2019;s run out at last.<br>&nbsp;<br>He prises open one stuck eye. But &#x2013; <br>&nbsp;<br>Daniel sits up on the sand and the stones<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2013; is this it? really? this? is death?<br>&nbsp;<br>He shades his eyes. Very bright.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sunlit. Terribly cold, though.<br>&nbsp;<br>He is on a sandy stony strand, the wind distinctly harsh, the sun out, yes, but no heat off it. Naked, too. No wonder he&#x2019;s cold. He looks down and sees that his body&#x2019;s still the old body, the ruined knees.<br>&nbsp;<br>He&#x2019;d imagined death would distil a person, strip the rotting rot away till everything was light as a cloud.<br>&nbsp;<br>Seems the self you get left with on the shore, in the end, is the self that you were when you went.<br>&nbsp;<br>If I&#x2019;d known, Daniel thinks, I&#x2019;d have made sure to go at twenty, twenty five.<br>&nbsp;<br>Only the good.<br>&nbsp;<br>Or perhaps (he thinks, one hand shielding his face so if anyone can see him no one will be offended by him picking out what&#x2019;s in the lining of his nose, or giving it a look to see what it is &#x2013; it&#x2019;s sand, beautiful the detail, the different array of colours of even the pulverized world, then he rubs it away off his fingertips) this <i>is </i>my self distilled. If so then death&#x2019;s a sorry disappointment.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thank you for having me, death. Please excuse me, must get back to it, life.<br>&nbsp;<br>He stands up. It doesn&#x2019;t hurt, not so much, to.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now then.<br>&nbsp;<br>Home. Which way?<br>&nbsp;<br>He turns a half circle. Sea, shoreline, sand, stones. Tall grass, dunes. Flatland behind the dunes. Trees past the flatland, a line of woods, all the way back round to the sea again.<br>&nbsp;<br>The sea is strange and calm.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then it strikes him how unusually good his eyes are today.<br>&nbsp;<br>I mean, I can see not just those woods, I can see not just that tree, I can see not just that leaf on that tree. I can see the stem connecting that leaf to that tree.<br>&nbsp;<br>He can focus on the loaded seedhead at the end of any piece of grass on those dunes over there pretty much as if he were using a camera zoom. And did he just look down at his own hand and see not just his hand, in focus, and not just a scuff of sand on the side of his hand, but several separate grains of sand so clearly delineated that he can see their edges, and (hand goes to his forehead) <i>no glasses </i>?<br>&nbsp;<br>Well.<br>&nbsp;<br>He rubs sand off his legs and arms and chest then off his hands. He watches the flight of the grains of it as it dusts away from him in the air. He reaches down, fills his hand with sand. Look at that. So many.<br>&nbsp;<br>Chorus:<br>&nbsp;<br>How many worlds can you hold in a hand.<br>&nbsp;<br>In a handful of sand.<br>&nbsp;<br>(Repeat.)<br>&nbsp;<br>He opens his fingers. The sand drifts down.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now that he&#x2019;s up on his feet he is hungry. Can you be hungry <i>and </i>dead? Course you can, all those hungry ghosts eating people&#x2019;s hearts and minds. He turns the full circle back to the sea. He hasn&#x2019;t been on a boat for more than fifty years, and that wasn&#x2019;t really a boat, it was a terrible novelty bar, party place on the river. He sits down on the sand and stones again but the bones are hurting in his, he doesn&#x2019;t want to use impolite language, there&#x2019;s a girl there further up the shore, are hurting like, he doesn&#x2019;t want to use impolite &#x2013; <br>&nbsp;<br>A girl?<br>&nbsp;<br>Yes, with a ring of girls round her, all doing a wavy ancient Greek looking dance. The girls are quite close. They&#x2019;re coming closer.<br>&nbsp;<br>This won&#x2019;t do. The nakedness.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then he looks down again with his new eyes at where his old body was a moment ago and he knows he is dead, he must be dead, he is surely dead, because his body looks different from the last time he looked down at it, it looks better, it looks rather good as bodies go. It looks very familiar, very like his own body but back when it was young.<br>&nbsp;<br>A girl is nearby. Girls. Sweet deep panic and shame flood through him.<br>&nbsp;<br>He makes a dash for the long grass dunes (he can run, really run!), he puts his head round the side of a grass tuft to check nobody can see him, nobody coming, and up and off (again! not even breathless) across the flatland towards those woods.<br>&nbsp;<br>There will be cover in the woods.<br>&nbsp;<br>There will maybe be something too with which to cover himself up. But pure joy! He&#x2019;d forgotten what it feels like, to feel. To feel even just the thought of one&#x2019;s own bared self near someone else&#x2019;s beauty.</p><h2>Geek Love</h2><p><b>Geek Love</b> is the story of the Binewskis, a carny family whose mater- and paterfamilias set out&#x2013;with the help of amphetamine, arsenic, and radioisotopes&#x2013;to breed their own exhibit of human oddities.

This installment widens the lens to encompass the whole field of science. As usual, the story begins in the classroom, where the students are agonizing over the upcoming science fair. A field trip to the nearby science museum provides inspiration, and in the galleries, the class discovers a model school bus, which conveys the crew back through time, where they meet famous scientists, such as Galileo and the Curies, and witness pivotal discoveries. This has all the hallmarks of the winning series: humorous cartoon speech bubbles; instructive, funny, appealing illustrations; and clear language that explains basic concepts without condescension. An excellent introduction to scientists and what they do, this title cements the series' long-standing reputation as one of the most exciting, approachable elementary-school science resources. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Offering allusive and exquisitely crafted insights into the brief joys of the present and the uncertain nature of the future, his Odes and Epodes explore such diverse themes as the virtues of pastoral life, the joys of wine, friendship and love, and the poet's personal anguish following Brutus' defeat at the battle of Phillipi. Ranging from subtle and tender hymns to the gods to bawdy celebrations of human passions, they remain among the most influential of all poems, inspiring poets from the Roman era to the European Renaissance, the Enlightenment and beyond.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>Hoace&#39;s Odes- allusive and exquisitely crafted poems of politics and the all-too-fleeting pleasure of friendship, love and wine- are without parallel in their influence on European literature. The Epodes, by contrast, are most notable for their coarse abuse and lively obscenity.<b>Quintus Horatius Flaccus</b> was born in 6 B.C. at Venusia in Apulia. His father, though once a slave, had made enough money as an auctioneer to send his son to a well-known school in Rome and subsequently to university in Athens. There Horace joined Brutus&#x2019; army and served on his staff until the defeat at Philippi in 42 BC. On returning to Rome, he found that his father was dead and his property had been confiscated, but he succeeded in obtaining a secretarial post in the treasury, which gave him enough to live on. The poetry he wrote in the next few years impressed Virgil, who introduced him to the great patron Maecenas in 38 BC. This event marked the beginning of a life-long friendship. From now on Horace had no financial worries; he moved freely among the leading poets and statesmen of Rome; his work was admired by Augustus, and indeed after Virgil&#x2019;s death in 19 BC he was virtually Poet Laureate. Horace died in 8 BC, only a few months after Maecenas.<br><b><br>Betty Radice</b> read classics at Oxford, then married and, in the intervals of bringing up a family, tutored in classics, philosophy and English.

Originally published in 1932, predating by more than a half century the current interest in the mind&#x2019;s power to heal, this concise work guides readers through what Israel Regardie calls the Middle Pillar meditation &#x2014; a technique that combines the mystical concepts of yoga&#x2019;s chakras and the Kabbalah&#x2019;s Tree of Life to create a simple and effective healing tool.<br><br>In this edition, editor Marc Allen brings Regardie&#x2019;s work into the twenty-first century &#x2014; showing us how to unleash energy to heal our bodies and, ultimately, every part of our lives. Like few books before or since, <i>The Art of True Healing</i> provides both the theory and practices necessary for attaining well-being and fulfillment.<br></p><p>In 1932, long before it was trendy or even acceptable to say so, Dr. Israel Regardie wrote a book that linked prayer and meditation to healing. Sixty-five years later his book has been reprinted and repackaged. Thankfully, though, Regardie&#39;s original voice remains unaltered. At face value, this is an instruction book, detailing a specific meditation practice that integrates the awareness of yoga&#39;s chakras with the Kabbalah&#39;s Tree of Life to present a daily tool for healing. The lesser-known value, however, is that this is a highly readable book that boldly explores what many healers are only now willing to say.Hailed as one of the most important figures in twentieth-century Western mysticism, <b>Dr. Israel Regardie</b> was a therapist and chiropractor who practiced a form of psychotherapy based on the work of Dr. Wilhelm Reich. A student of the Bhagavad Gita, Buddhism, Madame Blavatsky&#x2019;s theosophy, and yoga, Regardie was the author of seventeen books including <i>The Golden Dawn</i>, a monumental study of Western magical ritual.</p><h2>Changes for Molly (American Girl Collection)</h2><p>Molly can&#39;t wait for Dad to come home--he&#39;ll arrive in time to see her dance the part of Miss Victory in the big Red Cross show!

Things couldn&#39;t be worse--until the doctor comes just in time.</p><p>Grade 3-6 Three more titles about three girls in different American eras, all dealing with some kind of change in their lives. Kirsten, a ten-year-old Swedish immigrant living with her family on the Minnesota frontier in 1854, must deal with her cabin burning down and moving to a new home. Samantha, a wealthy orphan living with her aunt and uncle in New York City in 1904, spends her five chapters helping her poor friend Nellie, who has been orphaned and sent first to a drunken uncle and then to a Dickensian orphanage replete with evil directress. Molly, a ten-year-old in 1944, is pinning all her hopes on being the tap-dancing Miss Victory in a big show at the veteran's hospital, but things don't work out quite the way she plans. The format of each title is the same. All open with a double-spread of portraits and descriptors introducing the main character's family and friends (although all of characters may not appear in all stories) and close with a "Looking Back" section which hits the social history highlights of the United States of that period. The stock types ("Samantha's poor friend," "Kirsten's secret friend, an Indian girl," "Molly's other best friend, a cheerful dreamer") seem to preclude much peripheral character development, but also make it possible for each story to stand alone, without having read previous episodes. The brief stories tend to focus on events and action, which makes for a quick pace but some occasional lapses in explanation and follow-through. The six-page historical sections focus on changes in America, particularly for women, and are generally a good back-up to the stories' smoothly integrated period details. The selection of historical photos is excellent, although the texts are unavoidably superficial and stick to a middle-class lens in viewing American life. Their generalizations can also fail to provide a context for specific story events. The full-color illustrations, in occasional full-pages and frequent small edge-of-text drawings, capture the feel of the periods and give life to the characters (although the expressions in Kirsten's story are frequently awkward). While these aren't top drawer items (Kirsten, for example, is no Caddie Woodlawn, nor is her story of Sarah, Plain and Tall caliber), they're certainly lively and appealing enough to serve as introductions to historical fiction.

Pirsig's <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> is a powerful, moving, and penetrating examination of how we live . . . and a breathtaking meditation on how to live better. Here is the book that transformed a generation: an unforgettable narration of a summer motorcycle trip across America's Northwest, undertaken by a father and his young son. A story of love and fear -- of growth, discovery, and acceptance -- that becomes a profound personal and philosophical odyssey into life's fundamental questions, this uniquely exhilarating modern classic is both touching and transcendent, resonant with the myriad confusions of existence . . . and the small, essential triumphs that propel us forward.</p></p><p>In his now classic <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>, Robert Pirsig brings us a literary chautauqua, a novel that is meant to both entertain and edify. It scores high on both counts.<p> Phaedrus, our narrator, takes a present-tense cross-country motorcycle trip with his son during which the maintenance of the motorcycle becomes an illustration of how we can unify the cold, rational realm of technology with the warm, imaginative realm of artistry. As in Zen, the trick is to become one with the activity, to engage in it fully, to see and appreciate all details--be it hiking in the woods, penning an essay, or tightening the chain on a motorcycle. </p><p> In his autobiographical first novel, Pirsig wrestles both with the ghost of his past and with the most important philosophical questions of the 20th century--why has technology alienated us from our world? what are the limits of rational analysis? if we can't define the good, how can we live it? Unfortunately, while exploring the defects of our philosophical heritage from Socrates and the Sophists to Hume and Kant, Pirsig inexplicably stops at the middle of the 19th century. With the exception of Poincar�, he ignores the more recent philosophers who have tackled his most urgent questions, thinkers such as Peirce, Nietzsche (to whom Phaedrus bears a passing resemblance), Heidegger, Whitehead, Dewey, Sartre, Wittgenstein, and Kuhn. In the end, the narrator's claims to originality turn out to be overstated, his reasoning questionable, and his understanding of the history of Western thought sketchy. His solution to a synthesis of the rational and creative by elevating Quality to a metaphysical level simply repeats the mistakes of the premodern philosophers. But in contrast to most other philosophers, Pirsig writes a compelling story. And he is a true innovator in his attempt to popularize a reconciliation of Eastern mindfulness and nonrationalism with Western subject/object dualism. The magic of <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> turns out to lie not in the answers it gives, but in the questions it raises and the way it raises them. Like a cross between <i>The Razor's Edge</i> and <i>Sophie's World</i>, <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i> takes us into "the high country of the mind" and opens our eyes to vistas of possibility. <i>--Brian Bruya</i></p>The extraordinary story of a man's quest for truth.

Re-creating the epic campaign that culminated at Vicksburg, Groom details the arduous struggle by the Union to gain control of the Mississippi River valley and to divide the Confederacy in two. He takes us back to 1861, when Lincoln chooses Ulysses S. Grant&#x2014;seen at the time as a mediocre general with a drinking problem&#x2014;to lead the Union army south from Illinois.<br><br>We follow Grant and his troops as they fight one campaign after another, including the famous engagements at Forts Henry and Donelson and the bloodbath at Shiloh, until, after almost a year, they close in on Vicksburg. We witness Grant&#x2019;s seven long months of battle against the determined Confederate army, and the many failed Union attempts to take Vicksburg, during which thousands of soldiers on both sides would be buried and, ultimately, the fate of the Confederacy would be sealed. As Groom recounts this landmark confrontation, he brings the participants to life. We see Grant in all his grim determination, the feistiness of William Tecumseh Sherman, and the pride and intransigence of Confederate leaders from Jefferson Davis and General Joseph E. Johnston to General John C. Pemberton, the Philadelphia-born Rebel who commanded at Vicksburg and took the blame for losing.<br><br>A first-rate work of military history and an essential contribution to our understanding of the Civil War.</p><p>Winston Groom is the author of fourteen previous books, including <i>Patriotic Fire,</i> <i>Shrouds of Glory, Forrest Gump,</i> and <i>Conversations with the Enemy </i>(with Duncan Spencer), which was a Pulitzer Prize finalist. He lives with his wife and daughter in Point Clear, Alabama.Admiral Porter had his own ideas for the Rebels&#x2019; undoing, which presently had nothing to do with armies or canals or amphibious landings. Instead, after correctly identifying the two main objectives of the Mississippi campaign, he just as correctly proceeded to separate them. One, of course, was to reopen the river to commercial traffic from the Midwest to the Gulf and thence to ports far and wide. Desirable as this was, it would still require the reduction of Vicksburg and Port Hudson, which only the army could accomplish, and they weren&#x2019;t getting anywhere fast. From a purely military standpoint, however, the second goal was even more vital, and that was to sever the Confederate connection between the bountiful lands of the trans- Mississippi, since the ultimate destination of their bounty was the Rebel armies of Virginia, Tennessee, and Mississippi.<br><br>In sheer size, the trans- Mississippi was nearly as large as the rest of the Confederacy east of the river. Up until then it had provided the South with more than 100,000 soldiers, about 30 percent of the number presently serving under arms. Perhaps even more significantly, the trans- Mississippi was an inexhaustible granary that supplied much of the beef, corn, hogs, rice, wheat, and staples that filled stockpiles in Atlanta and Richmond. Not only that, but because of the blockade it also was a major conduit of European arms, munitions, and medical supplies through supposedly neutral Mexico. Cut off the supplies, Porter reasoned, and the enemy armies would begin to wither and starve. His view was later shared by no less an authority than the Harvard historian and philosopher John Fiske, who wrote in 1900, &#x201c;To sever from the Confederacy its three trans- Mississippi states was an object of paramount importance. It would destroy nearly half its resisting power.&#x201d;<br><br>This Confederate pipeline had already suffered a major blow with the fall of Memphis, and Sherman, before going up the Yazoo to attack Chickasaw Bluffs, had seen to the destruction of the Shreveport and Vicksburg Railroad. While these actions went a long way toward cutting the connection, it still left almost three hundred miles of the Mississippi under Rebel control all the way down to Port Hudson, and it was upon this stretch that Porter cast his nautical eye. He already knew he could get his ironclads past the Vicksburg batteries&#x2014;albeit with the inevitably heavy damage&#x2014;and once below there would be no sustainable source of coal, and the fireboxes of the ironclad ships were not designed for burning wood. Porter was still trying to figure a way to solve that problem when a catalyst arrived in the shape of a big Confederate riverboat named City of Vicksburg that steamed up from the South laden with supplies and tied up at the town docks. The brazenness of this prompted the admiral to summon his newest charge, Colonel Charles Rivers Ellet, who a scant six months earlier had been a nineteen- year- old medical cadet. Following the death of his father during the Battle of Memphis, young Ellet now commanded the army ram fleet, which, over the protest of Secretary of War Stanton, had just been turned over to the navy. Porter now wanted to know if Ellet thought it was possible to send in one of his rams to sink the City of Vicksburg, which, to his eternal annoyance and disgust, was lying in plain sight of his flagship.*<br><br>Ellet replied that it was not only possible but, with himself in command, it was as good as done. Thus in the early hours of February 2, 1863, Ellet began sneaking downriver in Queen of the West, his best ram, which could burn either coal or wood. Elaborate preparations had been taken according to Porter&#x2019;s instructions, or so the admiral believed. Double bales of cotton had been placed around the decks to fortify against Confederate cannon shot, a nighttime attack had been ordered to minimize the danger from Rebel batteries, and Ellet had been told to strike the City of Vicksburg just aft of her wheel, then blast her with turpentine- encased shot in order to set her ablaze.<br><br>Everything was going according to plans until Ellet decided to change them. Told to attack while it was still dark, he dallied around with last- minute preparations so that it was after sunrise before he got into position, and by then the Vicksburg guns were on full alert. As in the ill- fated attempt to ram the Arkansas, a big river eddy caught Queen of the West just as she was bearing in and her blow glanced off. She fired her turpentine balls, setting Vicksburg afire, but the Rebel guns began exacting a stern toll. The cotton bales Ellet had layered around the superstructure caught fire and all hands were ordered out into the hail of enemy fire to shove them overboard. By then it was apparent no more could be done and, while hundreds of Vicksburgians ran onto the bluffs to watch, the Queen, still ablaze and being shot at by every gun in the batteries, bore off toward the western shore where Sherman had some batteries of his own.<br><br>After putting out the fire and looking things over, Ellet decided his damage was slight and Porter told him to push on downriver in search of Confederate supply ships. He was accompanied by the unarmed river steamer De Soto, which Sherman had lent him as a support vessel and safety valve, if trouble should occur. The first Rebel boat he caught up with was typical of the haul that was crossing on a daily basis from the trans- Mississippi. She was the steamer A. H. Baker, carrying 110,000 pounds of barreled pork, some five hundred live hogs, several tons of salt, and other sundries, bound for Port Hudson and points east. Thus encouraged, Ellet continued on his rampage.<br><br>By then the Confederates had put out the alarm but, even so, a number of their transports failed to get the word and were taken captive, including one boat with a party of women from New Orleans aboard, whose destination seemed to be Port Hudson. Porter floated down a barge of coal for Ellet, which he recovered and hid up a bayou, then began a campaign of pillage on the smaller streams feeding into the Mississippi. At one point he stopped at a plantation near Grand Gulf that had belonged to former president Zachary Taylor and appropriated its cotton. He sent parties of his &#x201c;marines&#x201d; ashore with orders to destroy enemy wagon trains and, if fired upon from the banks, burn the plantation homes nearby. After two weeks of this he made his first reckless mistake, violating Porter&#x2019;s orders to stay near the mouth of the Red River.<br><br>Full of as much steam as his boilers, Ellet took the Queen eighty miles up the Red River to see about a big gun the Confederates were rumored to be landing there. On the way he captured a steamer with 4,500 bushels of corn, a number of Confederate soldiers, and a German with $32,000 in his pocket. When he arrived at the place the gun was supposed to be delivered to, Ellet not only found himself bracketed and shot through and through by Rebel guns, but he got stuck on a sandbar and had to abandon ship, leaving the Queen in enemy hands. He and most of his crew escaped on the De Soto, which was following close behind, but she also ran aground and they were forced to re-escape on the captured Confederate corn boat.<br><br>For two days Ellet and his men desperately eluded a host of angry Rebel steamers that were now looking for him in every part of the river system. Out of food and fuel, the crew fed the corn into the engine&#x2019;s fireboxes and ate what was left, and it seemed only a matter of time before their unarmed boat would be apprehended. Then salvation appeared out of a Mississippi River fog in the form of the new ironclad Indianola, which Porter presciently had sent downriver when communications with Ellet were lost. After conferring with Indianola&#x2019;s captain, and explaining what had happened, Ellet and his people went north toward Vicksburg, assuming their mission had been accomplished. In Porter&#x2019;s eyes, it was nothing of the sort, for he viewed the loss of Queen of the West as a major defeat. &#x201c;I can give orders, but I cannot give officers good judgment,&#x201d; he telegraphed the secretary of the navy. &#x201c;The Indianola is now there by herself. Whether the commander will have the good sense not to be surprised, remains to be seen.&#x201d;<br><br>It did not take long for Porter to find out. Indianola&#x2019;s captain hung around for two extra days, by which time the Confederates had not only repaired and manned Queen of the West but also sicced upon him the formidable William H. Webb, a converted steam ram. On the moonlit night of February 24, these two caught up with the Yankee gunboat about twenty- five miles south of Vicksburg. In the ensuing battle, the mighty Indianola got herself sunk in ten feet of water and her crew made prisoners, and Porter&#x2019;s humiliation was complete, or so it seemed. But then there occurred one of those weird and wonderful incidents, which on the rarest of occasions can make war actually seem like fun.<br><br>Next morning, after Porter recovered from his fury over losing the Indianola, he concocted a delicious plot to keep her from falling into Rebel hands. First he commandeered a large river flatboat and set a veritable army of carpenters to work, dolling her up like a Union ironclad. By late afternoon, the barge had been extended to more than three hundred feet long, with forty- foot- high enclosed paddle wheel&#x2013;houses made out of a cabin hauled from a nearby plantation, two tall smokestacks of nailed- together barrels set upon smoldering tar pots, and a big &#x201c;Quaker gun&#x201d; that poked menacingly forward. To conceal the hasty work, the dummy ship was plastered with tar and christened &#x201c;Black Terror,&#x201d; complete with the Stars and Stripes flying from a flagstaff. As a finishing touch, some wag nailed a sign on its side: deluded people, cave in! The finished cost of the hoax ship, Porter claimed, had been $8.63. Just before midnight a Union towboat dragged the creature around to the bend above Vicksburg and cut it loose downriver.<br><br>When the Confederate batteries...</p><h2>Bauhaus</h2><p><strong>Best of Bauhaus: An in-depth study of the seminal movement in art and architecture</strong> &nbsp; The Bauhaus Archiv/Museum of Design in Berlin holds the most important collection on the Bauhaus today.

I lick my lips, tasting water, salt, blood. Slowly, I lift my head, only for my temple to explode in agony. I wince, tucking my chin reflexively against my chest, then rest my aching forehead against hard plastic. The steering wheel of my car, I realize, is now crushed against my chest, while my leg is twisted at a nearly impossible angle, my knee wedged somewhere under the crumpled dash. I have fallen, I think, and I can&#x2019;t get up.</p><p>I hear a sound. Laughter. Or maybe it&#x2019;s keening. It&#x2019;s a strange sound.

Laboriously, the keening sound replaced by a soul-wrenching scream as I attempt to extricate myself from the driver&#x2019;s seat. My vehicle appears to have landed on its front end, the dash nearly crushed against me. I&#x2019;m not upright, but tilted forward, as if my Audi, once it broke its nose, couldn&#x2019;t regain its balance. It means I have to work doubly hard to unpin myself from the accordionized space between my seat and the steering wheel and collapsed dash.</p><p>Airbag. The excess mass wraps around my arms, tangles up my hands, and I curse it. Back to screaming and fighting and ranting gibberish, but the senseless rage spikes my adrenaline until at least the crushing fatigue is gone, and now there is only pain, an endless, terrible pain I already understand I can&#x2019;t afford to contemplate, as I finally wiggle my way sideways from between the driver&#x2019;s seat and the dash. I collapse, panting heavily, onto the center console. Legs work. Arms, too.</p><p>Head&#x2019;s on fire. </p><p>Vero.</p><p>Smoke. Do I smell smoke? I suffer an immediate bolt of panic. Smoke, screams, fire. Smoke, screams, fire.</p><p>Vero, Vero, Vero.</p><p>Run!</p><p>No. I catch myself. No smoke. That was the first time. How many times can a woman die? I&#x2019;m not sure. It&#x2019;s a blur in my head, from the smell of wet earth to the heat of flames. All separate and yet together. I am dying. I am dead. No, I am merely dying. No, wait, I am dead. The first time, the second time, the third?</p><p>I can&#x2019;t sort it out.</p><p>Only one thing matters, has ever mattered. Vero. I must save Vero. Backseat. I twist myself around. I hit first my left knee, then my right, and scream again. Fuck it. Don&#x2019;t care. Backseat. I have to get<br>to the backseat.</p><p>I fumble around in the dark, licking rain and mud from my lips as other impressions start to register. The windshield is shattered, but also the moonroof, hence the inside rain. My once gorgeous, relatively new and luxurious Audi Q5 crossover SUV has been shortened by at least a foot, if not two, the front end sustaining the worst of the impact and the front doors most likely too warped to open. But the back appears to be relatively intact.</p><p>&#x201c;Vero, Vero, Vero.&#x201d;</p><p>I realize for the first time I am wearing gloves. Or used to be wearing gloves. The glass has shredded them into large bloody flaps that hinder my movements. I wrestle the first one off, then the second, then jam them self-consciously in my pants pocket. Can&#x2019;t toss them on the floor. That would be littering and I treat my car better than that. Used to treat my car better than that?</p><p>My head hurts so damn much. I want to curl up in a ball and sleep and sleep and sleep.</p><p>But I don&#x2019;t. I can&#x2019;t. Vero.</p><p>Forcing myself to move once more, I rummage right, then left, fingers fumbling in the dark. But I find nothing. No one. I search and search, first the backseat, then, more shakily, the floor. But no small body magically appears.</p><p>What if . . . She could&#x2019;ve been thrown, tossed from the airborne vehicle. The car had tried to fly, and maybe so had Vero.</p><p>Mommy, look at me. I&#x2019;m an airplane.</p><p>What have I done, what have I done, what have I done?</p><p>I must get out of the vehicle. Nothing else matters. Out there, something in the dark, the rain, the mud. Vero. I must save her.</p><p>I drag myself by the elbows from the front of my crumpled car to the back. Then, a sharp turn for the rear passenger&#x2019;s door. But it won&#x2019;t open. I yank the handle, smearing blood. I shove against the door. Cry, beg and plead, but nothing. It won&#x2019;t give. The damage, the child&#x2019;s safety lock. Shit!</p><p>One other exit. The way back, rear cargo hatch. Moving again, painfully slow as the pain in my head turns to nausea in my stomach, and I know I&#x2019;m going to vomit, but I don&#x2019;t care. I have to get out of this car. I have to find Vero.</p><p>The puke, when it comes, is a thin liquid spew that smells of expensive single malt and a long night&#x2019;s regret.</p><p>I drag myself through the heinous puddle and keep going. First lucky break: The collision has jarred the rear hatch open.</p><p>I push it the rest of the way up. Then, when crawling proves too much for my bruised&#x2014;broken?&#x2014;ribs, I drag myself out with my arms and belly flop onto the ground. Mud, soft and oozing, eases my fall. I roll over, panting from the pain, the force of my exertions, the hopelessness of my situation.</p><p>Rain, rain, go away, please come back some other day. </p><p>Mommy, look at me, I&#x2019;m an airplane.</p><p>I&#x2019;m tired again. Fatigue, crushing and deep. I could just lie here. Help will come. Someone who saw the accident, heard the crash. Another motorist passing by. Or maybe someone will miss me. Someone who cares.</p><p>An image of a man&#x2019;s face pops into my mind but is gone before<br>I can catch it.</p><p>&#x201c;Vero,&#x201d; I whisper. To the falling rain, the oozing mud, the star- less night.</p><p>The smell of smoke, I think idly. The heat of fire. No, that was the first time. Focus, dammit. Focus!</p><p>I roll back over and begin my journey.</p><p>The road appears to be high above me. There is mud, grass, scraggly bushes and sharp rocks between it and me. I hear distant sounds, cars whizzing above me, like exotic birds, and I realize, as I belly crawl forward inch by inch, that the vehicles are too far away. They are up; I am down. They will never see me. They will never stop and help me find Vero.</p><p>Another inch, two, three, four. Gasping as I hit a rock. Cursing as I tangle in a bush. My trembling fingers reaching forward, searching, searching, searching. While my head screams in agony and I pause, time after time, to retch pathetic little spits of bile.</p><p>Vero.</p><p>And then: Oh, Nicky, what have you done?</p><p>I hear that keening noise again, but I don&#x2019;t stop. I don&#x2019;t want to realize that the distressed animal making all those sounds is actually me.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know how long I wriggle myself up through the slipping, sliding mud. I know by the time I crest the hill, I&#x2019;m covered head to toe in black ooze, and far from disturbing me, it amuses me. It&#x2019;s fitting, I think. I look as I ought to look.</p><p>Like a woman who&#x2019;s crawled from the grave.</p><p>Lights. Twin pinpricks, looming closer. I get up on my hands and knees now. Have to, if the passing motorist is to see me. And it&#x2019;s okay, because my ribs don&#x2019;t hurt anymore. My body has gone numb, the screaming in my head having overloaded all circuits and left everything else curiously blank.</p><p>Maybe I&#x2019;m already dead. Maybe this is what the dead look like, as I get one foot beneath me and, slowly but surely, rise to standing.</p><p>A screech of brakes. The oncoming car, fishtailing briefly as the driver overapplies the brakes in the wet conditions. Then, miraculously, it stops, right before my raised hand and pale, rain-streaked face.</p><p>&#x201c;Holy&#x2014;&#x201d; An elderly man, clearly shaken, is briefly illuminated by the interior light as he opens the driver&#x2019;s side door. He steps out uncertainly, rises to standing. &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, are you all right?&#x201d;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t say a word.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it an accident? Where&#x2019;s your car? Ma&#x2019;am, you want me to dial nine-one-one?&#x201d;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t say a word. </p><p>I just think: Vero.</p><p>And suddenly, I remember. I remember everything. An enormous explosion of light, terror and rage. A shooting pain not only through my head but through my heart. And in that instant, I recall exactly who I am. The monster from underneath the bed.</p><p>Across from me, as if sensing my thoughts, the old man recoils, takes a small step back.</p><p>&#x201c;Um . . . just stay there, ma&#x2019;am. Just . . . I&#x2019;ll, um, I&#x2019;ll phone for help.&#x201d;</p><p>The man disappears back inside the dimly lit interior of his car. I don&#x2019;t say anything. I stand in the rain, swaying on my feet.</p><p>I think, one last time: Vero.</p><p>Then the moment is gone, the memory passed.</p><p>And I am no one at all, just a woman twice returned from the dead.<br></p><p>Chapter 2<br></p><p> <br>The call came in shortly after 5 a.m.: single MVA, off the road, unknown injuries. Given that the town in question didn&#x2019;t have a nighttime duty officer&#x2014;welcome to the wilds of New Hampshire&#x2014; county patrol was dispatched to handle the situation. That officer, Todd Reynes, arrived fifteen minutes later&#x2014;again, welcome to the wilds of New Hampshire, or more accurately, long, windy back roads that never lead directly from here to there&#x2014;just as the EMTs were struggling to strap a single muddy, bloody woman onto a backboard. The driver, he was told, had definitely suffered extensive injuries and reeked of enough alcohol to make standing next to&nbsp;her a risk for a contact high.</p><p>A second motorist lingered nearby, the old guy who&#x2019;d found the woman and placed the initial call. He was keeping away from the action but acknowledged Officer Reynes with a short nod, clearly prepared to make a statement or sign on the dotted line or do whatever it was you did to officially end your part of something you never wanted to be involved with in the first place.</p><p>Officer Reynes returned the nod, already thinking this was pretty straightforward. One drunk driver, about to be hauled away by the EMTs. One smashed-up car, soon to be towed by the next available wrecker. That would be that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Last Steam Railroad in America</h2><p>Celebrates the Norfolk and Western Railway and the communities through which the last commercially-operated steam engines in America traveled.</p><p></p><h2>The Spy and the Traitor</h2><p>&#39;THE BEST TRUE SPY STORY I HAVE EVER READ&#39; JOHN LE CARR� A thrilling Cold War story about a KGB double agent, by one of Britain&#39;s greatest historians On a warm July evening in 1985, a middle-aged man stood on the pavement of a busy avenue in the heart of Moscow, holding a plastic carrier bag. In his grey suit and tie, he looked like any other Soviet citizen. The bag alone was mildly conspicuous, printed with the red logo of Safeway, the British supermarket. The man was a spy. A senior KGB officer, for more than a decade he had supplied his British spymasters with a stream of priceless secrets from deep within the Soviet intelligence machine. No spy had done more to damage the KGB. The Safeway bag was a signal: to activate his escape plan to be smuggled out of Soviet Russia. So began one of the boldest and most extraordinary episodes in the history of spying.

When the opportunity arose to train in the kitchen of Mario Batali&#x2019;s three-star New York restaurant, Babbo, Buford grabbed it. <i>Heat </i>is the chronicle&#x2014;sharp, funny, wonderfully exuberant&#x2014;of his time spent as Batali&#x2019;s &#x201c;slave&#x201d; and of his far-flung apprenticeships with culinary masters in Italy.<br><br>In a fast-paced, candid narrative, Buford describes the frenetic experience of working in Babbo&#x2019;s kitchen: the trials and errors (and more errors), humiliations and hopes, disappointments and triumphs as he worked his way up the ladder from slave to cook. He talks about his relationships with his kitchen colleagues and with the larger-than-life, hard-living Batali, whose story he learns as their friendship grows through (and sometimes despite) kitchen encounters and after-work all-nighters. <br><br>Buford takes us to the restaurant in a remote Appennine village where Batali first apprenticed in Italy and where Buford learns the intricacies of handmade pasta . . . the hill town in Chianti where he is tutored in the art of butchery by Italy&#x2019;s most famous butcher, a man who insists that his meat is an expression of the Italian soul . . . to London, where he is instructed in the preparation of game by Marco Pierre White, one of England&#x2019;s most celebrated (or perhaps notorious) chefs. And throughout, we follow the thread of Buford&#x2019;s fascinating reflections on food as a bearer of culture, on the history and development of a few special dishes (Is the shape of tortellini really based on a woman&#x2019;s navel? And just what is a short rib?), and on the what and why of the foods we eat today.<br><br><i>Heat</i> is a marvelous hybrid: a richly evocative memoir of Buford&#x2019;s kitchen adventure, the story of Batali&#x2019;s amazing rise to culinary (and extra-culinary) fame, a dazzling behind-the-scenes look at the workings of a famous restaurant, and an illuminating exploration of why food matters. <br><br>It is a book to delight in&#x2014;and to savor.</p><p>Bill Buford's funny and engaging book <i>Heat</i> offers readers a rare glimpse behind the scenes in Mario Batali's kitchen. Who better to review the book for Amazon.com, than Anthony Bourdain, the man who first introduced readers to the wide array of lusty and colorful characters in the restaurant business? We asked Anthony Bourdain to read <i>Heat</i> and give us his take. We loved it. So did he. Check out his review below. <i>--Daphne Durham</i> <strong>Guest Reviewer: Anthony Bourdain</strong><br><br><b>Anthony Bourdain is host of the Discovery Channel's <i>No Reservations</i>, executive chef at Les Halles in Manhattan, and author of the bestselling and groundbreaking <i>Kitchen Confidential</i>, <i>Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles Cookbook</i>, <i>A Cook's Tour</i>, <i>Bone in the Throat</i>, and many others. His latest book, <i>The Nasty Bits</i> will be released on May 16, 2006.</b><br><br> <i>Heat</i> is a remarkable work on a number of fronts--and for a number of reasons. First, watching the author, an untrained, inexperienced and middle-aged desk jockey slowly transform into not just a useful line cook--but an extraordinarily knowledgable one is pure pleasure. That he chooses to do so primarily in the notoriously difficult, cramped kitchens of New York's three star <i>Babbo</i> provides further sado-masochistic fun. Buford not only accurately and hilariously describes the painfully acquired techniques of the professional cook (and his own humiations), but chronicles as well the mental changes--the "kitchen awareness" and peculiar world view necessary to the kitchen dweller. By end of book, he's even talking like a line cook.<p> Secondly, the book is a long overdue portrait of the real Mario Batali and of the real Marco Pierre White--two complicated and brilliant chefs whose coverage in the press--while appropriately fawning--has never described them in their fully debauched, delightful glory. Buford has--for the first time--managed to explain White's peculiar--almost freakish brilliance--while humanizing a man known for terrorizing cooks, customers (and Batali). As for Mario--he is finally revealed for the Falstaffian, larger than life, mercurial, frighteningly intelligent chef/enterpreneur he really is. No small accomplishment. Other cooks, chefs, butchers, artisans and restaurant lifers are described with similar insight.</p><p> Thirdly, <i>Heat</i> reveals a dead-on understanding--rare among non-chef writers--of the pleasures of "making" food; the real human cost, the real requirements and the real adrenelin-rush-inducing pleasures of cranking out hundreds of high quality meals. One is left with a truly unique appreciation of not only what is truly good about food--but as importantly, who cooks--and why. I can't think of another book which takes such an unsparing, uncompromising and ultimately thrilling look at the quest for culinary excellence. <i>Heat</i> brims with fascinating observations on cooking, incredible characters, useful discourse and argument-ending arcania. I read my copy and immediately started reading it again. It's going right in between Orwell's <i>Down and Out in Paris and London</i> and Zola's <i>The Belly of Paris</i> on my bookshelf. <i>--Anthony Bourdain</i> </p><br>Bill Buford is a staff writer for <i>The New Yorker</i>, where he was the fiction editor for eight years.

Now, in <i>A Dublin Student Doctor,</i> Taylor turns back the clock to give us a portrait of the young Fingal&#x2015;and show us the pivotal events that shaped the man he would become.</p><p>In the 1930s, fresh from a stint in the Royal Navy Reserve, and against the wishes of his disapproving father, Fingal O'Reilly goes to Dublin to study medicine. Fingal and his fellow aspiring doctors face the arduous demands of Trinity College and Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital. The hours are long and the cases challenging, but Fingal manages to find time to box and play rugby&#x2015;and to romance a fetching, gray-eyed nurse named Kitty O'Hallorhan. </p><p>Dublin is a city of slums and tenements, where brutal poverty breeds diseases that the limited medical knowledge of the time is often ill-equipped to handle.

I&#x2019;d rather not see any in the ditch.&#x201d; The afternoon sun highlighted the amber flecks in her grey eyes. She put slim fingers on his arm.<br><br>&#x201c;Just for you, Kitty.&#x201d; He slowed and whistled &#x201c;Slow Boat to China.&#x201d; &#x201c;All right in the back?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine, Fingal,&#x201d; said O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s assistant, young Doctor Barry Laverty.<br><br>&#x201c;Grand, so.&#x201d; Mrs. Maureen &#x201c;Kinky&#x201d; Kincaid was O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s housekeeper, as she had been for Doctor Flanagan. Fingal had met Kinky when he&#x2019;d come as an assistant to Th�mas Flanagan in 1938. She&#x2019;d stayed on when a thirty-seven-year-old O&#x2019;Reilly returned in 1946 from his service in the Second World War and bought the general practice from Doctor Flanagan&#x2019;s estate.<br><br>They&#x2019;d been a good nineteen years, he thought as he put the car into a tight bend between two rows of ancient elms. So had his years as a medical student at Dublin&#x2019;s Trinity College in the &#x2019;30s.<br><br>&#x201c;Jasus thundering Murphy.&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly stamped on the brake. The Rover shuddered to a halt five yards from a man standing waving his arms.<br><br>O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s bushy eyebrows met. He could feel his temper rise and the tip of his bent nose blanch. &#x201c;Everyone all right?&#x201d; he roared, and was relieved to hear a chorus of reassurance. He hurled his door open and stamped up the road. &#x201c;What in the blue bloody blazes are you doing standing there waving your arms like an out-of-kilter semaphore? I could have squashed you flatter than a flaming flounder-fish.&#x201d;<br><br>The stranger wore Wellington boots, moleskin trousers, and a hacking jacket. He had a russet beard, a squint, and was no more than five foot two. O&#x2019;Reilly expected him at least to take a step back, apologise, but he stood his ground.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no need for youse &#x2019;til be losing the bap, so there&#x2019;s not. There&#x2019;s been an accident, and I&#x2019;m here to stop big buggers like youse driving into it, so I am. See for yourself.&#x201d; He pointed to a knot of people and the slowly rotating rear wheel of a motorbike that lay on its side.<br><br>&#x201c;Accident?&#x201d; said O&#x2019;Reilly. He spun on his heel. &#x201c;Barry. Grab my bag and come here.&#x201d; He turned back. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly. Doctor Laverty&#x2019;s coming.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Doctor? Thank God for that, sir. A motorcyclist took a purler on an oil slick, you know. Somebody&#x2019;s gone for the ambulance and police.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Here you are.&#x201d; Barry handed O&#x2019;Reilly his bag. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Motorbike accident.&#x201d; He spoke to the short man. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d be safer back down the road where drivers can see you before they&#x2019;re on top of you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right enough. I&#x2019;ll go, sir.&#x201d; He started walking.<br><br>O&#x2019;Reilly yelled, &#x201c;Kitty. Kinky. There&#x2019;s been an accident. Stay with the car.&#x201d; Kitty would have the wit to pull the car over to the verge. &#x201c;Come on, Barry.&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly marched straight to the little crowd. Time to use the voice that could be heard over a gale when he&#x2019;d served on the battleship HMS <i>Warspite.</i> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re doctors. Let us through.&#x201d;<br><br>Ruddy-cheeked country faces turned. Murmuring people shuffled aside and a path opened.<br><br>A motorbike lay on the road, an exclamation mark at the end of two long black scrawls of rubber. The engine ticked and the stink of oil and burnt tyre hung over the smell of ploughed earth from a field and the almond scent of whin flowers.<br><br>A middle-aged woman knelt beside the rider. The victim&#x2019;s head was turned away from O&#x2019;Reilly, but there could only be one owner of that red thatch. A duncher lay a few yards away. It irritated O&#x2019;Reilly that Ulstermen wouldn&#x2019;t wear crash helmets but favoured cloth caps, worn with the peak at the back.<br><br>He knelt beside the woman and set his bag on the ground. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s unconscious, he&#x2019;s breathing regular, his airway&#x2019;s clear, his pulse is eighty and regular, and he&#x2019;s not bleeding. There don&#x2019;t seem to be any bones broken,&#x201d; she said, and added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a first-aider, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Mrs.?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Meehan. Rosie Meehan.&#x201d;<br><br>O&#x2019;Reilly smiled at her. &#x201c;Donal? Donal?&#x201d; he said gently. Fifteen minutes ago he&#x2019;d seen Ballybucklebo&#x2019;s arch schemer, Donal Donnelly, riding the motorbike from the car park.<br><br>No reply.<br><br>O&#x2019;Reilly grabbed the man&#x2019;s wrist. Good. Mrs. Meehan was right; the pulse was strong and regular. &#x201c;Donal,&#x201d; he said more loudly, &#x201c;Donal.&#x201d;<br><br>Donal&#x2019;s face was chalky. He wore his raincoat reversed and buttoned over his back. It was the practice of country men when riding motorbikes. It stopped the wind of passage getting through.<br><br>O&#x2019;Reilly was hesitant to move Donal. He could have a broken neck. Better to wait for the ambulance. The first law of medicine was <i>Primum non nocere.</i> First do no harm. O&#x2019;Reilly bent lower. &#x201c;Donal?&#x201d;<br><br>Donal&#x2019;s eyelids fluttered. &#x201c;Numuh?&#x201d;<br><br>Better, O&#x2019;Reilly thought. Donal might only be concussed. If that were the case he should start regaining consciousness. But you could never be certain about head injuries. The damage might range from a simple concussion with complete recovery through to serious brain injury leading to paralysis, permanent brain damage, and even death. O&#x2019;Reilly gritted his teeth. Donal had a new wife and a wean on the way. O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s heart went out to the pregnant Julie Donnelly, n�e MacAteer. He heard the <i>nee-naw</i> of an approaching siren. O&#x2019;Reilly leant over. &#x201c;Donal?&#x201d;<br><br>Donal&#x2019;s eyes flew open. &#x201c;Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly? What are youse doing here?&#x201d; He struggled to rise. &#x201c;I shouldn&#x2019;t be in my bed.&#x201d;<br><br>Donal recognised O&#x2019;Reilly. That was a good sign even if he was unclear where he was. O&#x2019;Reilly put a restraining hand on the man&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Lie still. You had an accident.&#x201d;<br><br>Donal put his hand to his head. &#x201c;I must have hit my nut a right clatter,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s pounding to beat Bannagher, so it is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know what day it is?&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly asked.<br><br>Donal frowned. &#x201c;Uh? Saturday. We made a wheen of money on the oul gee-gees at the races.&#x201d; He grinned like a small boy who had answered the teacher&#x2019;s question correctly. &#x201c;And this here&#x2019;s the road to Ballybucklebo.&#x201d; A look of concern crossed his face. &#x201c;Jesus, is Paddy Regan&#x2019;s motorbike all right? It&#x2019;s only on loan.&#x201d; Donal tried to rise.<br><br>&#x201c;Stay put,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly said, and smiled. If Donal knew about events immediately preceding his accident it was probable he had suffered only a minor concussion. Even so, O&#x2019;Reilly would never forget a footballer who&#x2019;d been knocked out, recovered, gone back to finish the match, and died from a brain haemorrhage two hours later.<br><br>The <i>nee-naw, nee-naw</i> grew louder.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need no ambulance,&#x201d; Donal said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m for going home, so I am.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, Donal,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly said, &#x201c;but you&#x2019;ll be spending tonight in the Royal Victoria Hospital.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Och, Doctor&#x2014;that&#x2019;s daft. I&#x2019;ve a motorbike to get back to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Royal. For observation,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly said. &#x201c;No arguments. I&#x2019;ll take care of the bike.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Donal, you&#x2019;re going to hospital,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly said as if speaking to a not overly bright child. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s final.&#x201d; He stood and spoke to Barry. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do a quick neurological exam once he&#x2019;s in the ambulance. Establish a baseline in case he gets worse. I&#x2019;ll go up to the Royal with him. Kitty&#x2019;s the senior nursing sister on the neurosurgical ward there. She&#x2019;ll want to come too. She can go with Donal in the back of the ambulance. God knows she&#x2019;s observed a hundred times more head injuries than you and I put together. She&#x2019;ll keep an eye on him and warn me if his condition deteriorates. You drive Kinky and the Rover home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go and get Kitty.&#x201d; Barry started to turn as a yellow Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority ambulance drew up and its siren was turned off.<br><br>&#x201c;In a minute,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly said. &#x201c;Once the police have come and done whatever they have to do, measure things, take photos and statements, they&#x2019;ll have you fill in forms. When you&#x2019;re done, get them to give you a hand to load the bike into the boot of the Rover. At least Paddy Regan won&#x2019;t need to come all the way here to collect it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Paddy? I&#x2019;ll let him know,&#x201d; Barry said.<br><br>O&#x2019;Reilly turned. &#x201c;Do you hear that, Donal? We&#x2019;ll get the bike home for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks, Doc. But what about Julie? She&#x2019;ll go spare if ...</p><h2>Daughter of Smoke &amp; Bone (Daughter of Smoke &amp; Bone, 1)</h2><p><b>The first book in the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling epic fantasy trilogy by award-winning author Laini Taylor</b><br><br>Around the world, black handprints are appearing on doorways, scorched there by winged strangers who have crept through a slit in the sky.<br><br>In a dark and dusty shop, a devil's supply of human teeth grown dangerously low.<br><br>And in the tangled lanes of Prague, a young art student is about to be caught up in a brutal otherwordly war.<br><br>Meet Karou.

Exhilarating, hilarious, panoramic, and immediately engrossing, it is also&#x2014;at a distance of many thousand miles and more than a century&#x2014;a Great American Novel.<br><br>This is Ned Kelly's true confession, in his own words and written on the run for an infant daughter he has never seen. To the authorities, this son of dirt-poor Irish immigrants was a born thief and, ultimately, a cold-blooded murderer; to most other Australians, he was a scapegoat and patriot persecuted by "English" landlords and their agents.<br><br>With his brothers and two friends, Kelly eluded a massive police manhunt for twenty months, living by his wits and strong heart, supplementing his bushwhacking skills with ingenious bank robberies while enjoying the support of most everyone not in uniform. He declined to flee overseas when he could, bound to win his jailed mother's freedom by any means possible, including his own surrender. In the end, however, she served out her sentence in the same Melbourne prison where, in 1880, her son was hanged.<br><br>Still his country's most powerful legend, Ned Kelly is here chiefly a man in full: devoted son, loving husband, fretful father, and loyal friend, now speaking as if from the grave. With this mythic outlaw and the story of his mighty travails and exploits, and with all the force of a classic Western, Peter Carey has breathed life into a historical figure who transcends all borders and embodies tragedy, perseverance, and freedom.</p><p>"What is it about we Australians, eh?" demands a schoolteacher near the end of Peter Carey's <i>True History of the Kelly Gang</i>. "Do we not have a Jefferson? A Disraeli? Might not we find someone better to admire than a horse-thief and a murderer?" It's the author's sole nod to the contradictory feelings Ned Kelly continues to evoke today, more than a century after his death. A psychopathic killer to some, a crusading folk hero to others, Kelly was a sharpshooting outlaw who eluded a brutal police manhunt for nearly two years. For better or worse, he's now a part of the Australian national myth. Indeed, the opening ceremonies for the Sydney Olympics featured an army of Ned Kellys dancing about to Irish music, which puts him in the symbolic company of both kangaroos and Olivia Newton-John.<p> What's to be gained from telling this illiterate bushranger's story yet again? Quite a lot, as it turns out. For starters, there is the remarkable vernacular poetry of Carey's narrative voice. Fierce, funny, ungrammatical, steeped in Irish legends and the frontier's moral code, this voice is the novel's great achievement--and perhaps the greatest in Carey's distinguished career. It paints a vivid picture of an Australia where English landowners skim off the country's best territory while government land grants allow the settlers just enough acreage to starve. Cheated, lied to, and persecuted by the authorities at every opportunity, young Kelly retains no faith in his colonial masters. What he does trust, oddly, is the power of words: </p><blockquote> And here is the thing about them men they was Australians they knew full well the terror of the unyielding law the historic memory of UNFAIRNESS were in their blood and a man might be a bank clerk or an overseer he might never have been lagged for nothing but still he knew in his heart what it were to be forced to wear the white hood in prison he knew what it were to be lashed for looking a warder in the eye ... so the knowledge of unfairness were deep in his bone and in his marrow. </blockquote> Ned Kelly as literary hero? Strangely enough, that's what he becomes, at least in Carey's rendering. Pouring his heart out in a series of letters to the country at large, Kelly wants nothing more than to be <i>heard</i>--and for the dirt-poor son of an Irish convict, that's an audacious ambition indeed. It's not so surprising, then, that his story continues to speak to Australians. Like all colonial countries, Australia was built at a steep human price, and the memory of all those silenced voices lives on. <i>True History of the Kelly Gang</i> takes its epigraph from Faulkner: "The past is not dead. It is not even past." And like Faulkner's own vast chronicle of dispossession, it's haunted by tragedies as large as history itself. <i>--Mary Park</i>"Carey's True History of the Kelly Gang purports to transcribe documents, 'thirteen parcels of stained and dog-eared papers,' in which the celebrated outlaw, on the run, set down for the benefit of his daughter (whom he was destined never to see) a heartfelt account and justification of his short and violent life. The ingenuity, empathy, and poetic ear that the novelist brings to his feat of imposture cannot be rated too high; hardly a colloquialism feels turned wrong, hardly a homely phrase feels rote, patronizing, or quaint . . . The poetry that Carey can coax from this lightly educated ruffian's lightly punctuated prose gratifies us on every page [and] rises to the occasion like the Song of Songs." &#x2014;John Updike, The New Yorker <br><br> "This avalanche of a novel [raises] a national legend to the level of an international myth." <br> &#x2014;Ron Charles, The Christian Science Monitor <br><br> "A spectacular feat of literary ventriloquism [with] all the makings of a swaggering adventure tale as well as a classic Western tragedy. The effect is triumphantly eclectic, as if Huck Finn and Shakespeare had joined forces to prettify the legend of Jesse James . . . But this rip-snorting Western novel rises far above such considerations and works on its own great merits as a seamlessly imagined coming-of-age story set in wild country and wilder times. Though Ned Kelly died in 1880 just before his 26th birthday, he could not be more furiously alive." &#x2014;Janet Maslin, The New York Times <br><br> "The best measure of the novel's excellence [is] that you never doubt it's Kelly's own words you're reading in the headlong, action-packed story filled with stage-coach holdups, bank robberies and backstabbing treachery." <br> &#x2014;Malcolm Jones, Newsweek <br><br> "Ambitious and adventurous . . . from lyrical to rowdy and ribald . . . Peter Carey's Ned Kelly is somebody worth knowing and remembering, and his novel is also worth our best attention." &#x2014;George Garrett, The Washington Post Book World <br><br> "Highly original . . . To read it is to be carried away." &#x2014;Sara Dowse, The Minneapolis Star-Tribune <br><br> "True History of the Kelly Gang is a true wonder. It's lyrical and hard-edged at the same time, constantly inventive, pell-mell in its storytelling, and best of all, the voice Peter Carey invents for Ned Kelly is nothing less than mint-fresh original. This is just amazing writing." &#x2014;Kent Haruf <br><br> "A big, meaty novel, blending equal parts Dickens and Cormac McCarthy, and a complete success . . . Most immediately striking is how much it resembles an American Western about such legendary outlaws as Jesse James and Bonnie and Clyde." &#x2014;Ken Foster, The San Francisco Chronicle <br><br> "To succeed as literature a book must entertain. This novel is no exception&#x2014;a tough, sweet, rousing thing of ungrammatical sentences and unquestionable wisdom." &#x2014;Erik Torkells, Fortune <br><br> "There is certainly justice in putting True History on the bookshelf next to Shane . . . It rocks and cajoles the reader into a certainty that Ned Kelly is fit company not only for Jack Palance and Clint Eastwood but for Thomas Jefferson." &#x2014;Johnathan Levi, The Los Angeles Times <br><br> "The power and charm of True History [brings] Australia's legendary Ned Kelly vibrantly to life." &#x2014;Paul Gray, Time <br><br> "I completely admire Peter Carey's work&#x2014;the worlds he enters, the stakes he goes for&#x2014;and Ned Kelly's a leap even beyond the others, brilliantly constructed, gorgeously written, a simply heartbreaking story." &#x2014;Beverly Lowry <br><br> "Dazzling . . . narrated with great flair in prose heavy on expletives and light on punctuation&#x2014;yet full of music and poetry." &#x2014;The Economist <br><br> "Bolder and more challenging than anything [one of fiction's great treasure hunters] has attempted before . . . the book's power as a narrative is nearly overwhelming. The twang of Ned's untutored but vibrant prose would be hypnotic in itself, yet Carey adapts it to a series of set pieces . . . that are as gripping as any you could wish to read. He has transformed sepia legend into brilliant, even violent, color, and turned a distant myth into warm flesh and blood. Packed with incident, alive with comedy and pathos, True History of the Kelly Gang contains pretty much everything you could ask of a novel. It is an adjectival wonder. " &#x2014;Anthony Quinn, New York Times Book Review <br><br> "Wholly convincing not only as an outback adventure but also as a psychological and historical drama. It is, above all, a spectacular feat of imagination grounded in an Australian landscape [that] is an astonishing, apparently limitless place with mysteries of its own to reveal . . . Carey has immersed us so completely in Kelly's world and swept us along at such a cracking pace that the novel's last scene is physically draining, bewildering. Like Ned we can hardly believe it is all over." &#x2014;Anna Mundow, The Boston Sunday Globe <br><br>&#x201c;True History of the Kelly Gang is a true wonder. It&#x2019;s lyrical and hard-edged at the same time, constantly inventive, pell-mell in its storytelling, and, best of all, the voice Peter Carey invents for Ned Kelly is nothing less than mint-fresh original. This is just amazing writing.&#x201d; &#x2014;Kent Haruf<br><br>&#x201c;As genuine as a diamond in the rough . . . In essence an adventure saga, with numerous descriptions of the wild and forbidding Australian landscape, shocking surprises, coldhearted villains who hail from the top and the bottom of the social ladder, and a tender love story. Carey (Booker Prize winner for Oscar and Lucinda) deserves to be lionized in his native land for this triumphant historical recreation, and he will undoubtedly win a worldwide readership for a novel that teems with energy, suspense, and the true story of a memorable protagonist . . .

I came into this world on the fifth day of the six month of the third year of Emperor Daoguang&#x2019;s reign. Puwei, my home village, is in Yongming County, the county of Everlasting Brightness. Most people who live here are descended from the Yao ethnic tribe. From the storytellers who visited Puwei when I was a girl, I learned that the Yao first arrived in this area twelve hundred years ago during the Tang dynasty, but most families came a century later, when they fled the Mongol armies who invaded the north. Although the people of our region have never been rich, we have rarely been so poor that women had to work in the fields.<br><br>We were members of the Yi family line, one of the original Yao clans and the most common in the district. My father and uncle leased seven mou of land from a rich landowner who lived in the far west of the province. They cultivated that land with rice, cotton, taro, and kitchen crops. My family home was typical in the sense that it had two stories and faced south. A room upstairs was designated for women&#x2019;s gathering and for unmarried girls to sleep. Rooms for each family unit and a special room for our animals flanked the downstairs main room, where baskets filled with eggs or oranges and strings of drying chilies hung from the central beam to keep them safe from mice, chickens, or a roaming pig. We had a table and stools against one wall. A hearth where Mama and Aunt did the cooking occupied a corner on the opposite wall. We did not have windows in our main room, so we kept open the door to the alley outside our house for light and air in the warm months. The rest of our rooms were small, our floor was hard-packed earth, and, as I said, our animals lived with us.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve never thought much about whether I was happy or if I had fun as a child. I was a so-so girl who lived with a so-so family in a so-so village. I didn&#x2019;t know that there might be another way to live, and I didn&#x2019;t worry about it either. But I remember the day I began to notice and think about what was around me. I had just turned five and felt as though I had crossed a big threshold. I woke up before dawn with something like a tickle in my brain. That bit of irritation made me alert to everything I saw and experienced that day.<br><br>I lay between Elder Sister and Third Sister. I glanced across the room to my cousin&#x2019;s bed. Beautiful Moon, who was my age, hadn&#x2019;t woken up yet, so I stayed still, waiting for my sisters to stir. I faced Elder Sister, who was four years older than I. Although we slept in the same bed, I didn&#x2019;t get to know her well until I had my feet bound and joined the women&#x2019;s chamber myself. I was glad I wasn&#x2019;t looking in Third Sister&#x2019;s direction. I always told myself that since she was a year younger she was too insignificant to think about. I don&#x2019;t think my sisters adored me either, but the indifference we showed one another was just a face we put on to mask our true desires. We each wanted Mama to notice us. We each vied for Baba&#x2019;s attention. We each hoped we would spend time every day with Elder Brother, since as the first son he was the most precious person in our family. I did not feel that kind of jealousy with Beautiful Moon. We were good friends and happy that our lives would be linked together until we both married out.<br><br>The four of us looked very similar. We each had black hair that was cut short, we were very thin, and we were close in height. Otherwise, our distinguishing features were few. Elder Sister had a mole above her lip. Third Sister&#x2019;s hair was always tied up in little tufts, because she did not like Mama to comb it. Beautiful Moon had a pretty round face, while my legs were sturdy from running and my arms strong from carrying my baby brother.<br><br>&#x201c;Girls!&#x201d; Mama called up the stairs to us.<br><br>That was enough to wake up the others and get us all out of bed. Elder Sister hurriedly got dressed and went downstairs. Beautiful Moon and I were slower, because we had to dress not only ourselves but Third Sister as well. Then together we went downstairs, where Aunt swept the floor, Uncle sang a morning song, Mama&#x2014;with Second Brother swaddled on her back&#x2014;poured the last of the water into the teapot to heat, and Elder Sister chopped scallions for the rice porridge we call congee. My sister gave me a tranquil look that I took to mean that she had already earned the approval of my family this morning and was safe for the rest of the day. I tucked away my resentment, not understanding that what I saw as her self-satisfaction was something closer to the cheerless resignation that would settle on my sister after she married out.<br><br>&#x201c;Beautiful Moon! Lily! Come here! Come here!&#x201d;<br><br>My aunt greeted us this way each and every morning. We ran to her. Aunt kissed Beautiful Moon and patted my bottom affectionately. Then Uncle swooped in, swept up Beautiful Moon in his arms, and kissed her. After he set her back down, he winked at me and pinched my cheek.<br><br>You know the old saying about beautiful people marrying beautiful people and talented people marrying talented people? That morning I concluded that Uncle and Aunt were two ugly people and therefore perfectly matched. Uncle, my father&#x2019;s younger brother, had bowlegs, a bald head, and a full shiny face. Aunt was plump, and her teeth were like jagged stones protruding from a karst cave. Her bound feet were not very small, maybe fourteen centimeters long, twice the size of what mine eventually became. I&#x2019;d heard wicked tongues in our village say that this was the reason Aunt&#x2014;who was of healthy stock, with wide hips&#x2014;could not carry a son to term. I&#x2019;d never heard these kinds of reproaches in our home, not even from Uncle. To me, they had an ideal marriage; he was an affectionate rat and she was a dutiful ox. Every day they provided happiness around the hearth.<br><br>My mother had yet to acknowledge that I was in the room. This is how it had been for as long as I could remember, but on that day I perceived and felt her disregard. Melancholy sank into me, whisking away the joy I had just felt with Aunt and Uncle, stunning me with its power. Then, just as quickly, the feeling disappeared, because Elder Brother, who was six years older than I was, called me to help him with his morning chores. Having been born in the year of the horse, it is in my nature to love the outdoors, but even more important I got to have Elder Brother completely to myself. I knew I was lucky and that my sisters would hold this against me, but I didn&#x2019;t care. When he talked to me or smiled at me I didn&#x2019;t feel invisible.<br><br>We ran outside. Elder Brother hauled water up from the well and filled buckets for us to carry. We took them back to the house and set out again to gather firewood. We made a pile, then Elder Brother loaded my arms with the smaller sticks. He scooped up the rest and we headed home. When we got there, I handed the sticks to Mama, hoping for her praise. After all, it&#x2019;s not so easy for a little girl to lug a bucket of water or carry firewood. But Mama didn&#x2019;t say anything.<br><br>Even now, after all these years, it is difficult for me to think about Mama and what I realized on that day. I saw so clearly that I was inconsequential to her. I was a third child, a second worthless girl, too little to waste time on until it looked like I would survive my milk years. She looked at me the way all mothers look at their daughters&#x2014;as a temporary visitor who was another mouth to feed and a body to dress until I went to my husband&#x2019;s home. I was five, old enough to know I didn&#x2019;t deserve her attention, but suddenly I craved it. I longed for her to look at me and talk to me the way she did with Elder Brother. But even in that moment of my first truly deep desire, I was smart enough to know that Mama wouldn&#x2019;t want me to interrupt her during this busy time when so often she had scolded me for talking too loudly or had swatted at the air around me because I got in her way. Instead, I vowed to be like Elder Sister and help as quietly and carefully as I could.<br><br>Grandmother tottered into the room. Her face looked like a dried plum, and her back bent so far forward that she and I saw eye to eye.<br><br>&#x201c;Help your grandmother,&#x201d; Mama ordered. &#x201c;See if she needs anything.&#x201d;<br><br>Even though I had just made a promise to myself, I hesitated. Grandmother&#x2019;s gums were sour and sticky in the mornings, and no one wanted to get near her. I sidled up to her, holding my breath, but she waved me away impatiently. I moved so quickly that I bumped into my father&#x2014;the eleventh and most important person in our household.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t reprimand me or say anything to anyone else. As far as I knew, he wouldn&#x2019;t speak until this day was behind him. He sat down and waited to be served. I watched Mama closely as she wordlessly poured his tea. I may have been afraid that she would notice me during her morning routine, but she was even more mindful in her dealings with my father. He rarely hit my mother and he never took a concubine, but her caution with him made us all heedful.<br><br>Aunt put bowls on the table and spooned out the congee, while Mama nursed the baby. After we ate, my father and my uncle set out for the fields, and my mother, aunt, grandmother, and older sister went upstairs to the women&#x2019;s chamber. I wanted to go with Mama and the other women in our family, but I wasn&#x2019;t old enough.

His stand-alone novel <i>The Lock Artist</i> was named a <i>New York Times </i>Notable Crime Book, received an Alex Award from the American Library Association, and then went on to win the Edgar Award for Best Novel, making him only the second author (after Ross Thomas) to win Edgars for both Best First Novel and Best Novel. He attended the University of Michigan, where he won the prestigious Hopwood Award for writing, and now lives in Cottekill, New York, with his wife and their two children.CHAPTER ONE <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Summers die hard in Paradise. <br>The first time you live through it, and because this place still has the &#x201c;MI&#x201d; as part of the address, you might actually expect the summer to fade away slowly like it does below the bridge. Down there, on a crystal blue day in September, the sun shining hot and bright until it starts to go down, you might feel a slight note of coolness in the air, a note that makes you think of football and back-to-school and leaves turning and all those other bittersweet signs that the season is changing. Something so subtle you might even be forgiven for missing it the first time it happened. Especially if you didn&#x2019;t want the summer to end. <br>Up here, on the shores of Lake Superior, there&#x2019;s a cold wind that gathers from the north and picks up weight as it builds its way across two hundred miles of open water, and then, on a late afternoon in August&#x2014;hell, sometimes in July&#x2014;that wind hits you square in the face and makes its intention quite clear, no matter how much you might not like the message. Summer may not be one hundred percent done, not just yet, but it&#x2019;s been mortally gutshot, and it&#x2019;s only a matter of days until it&#x2019;s gone. <br>It was late August this time around. Actual <i>late</i> August, meaning an absurdly long summer. I&#x2019;ve got six cabins stretched along an old logging road, built by my father, and in the summer I rent them out to a particular brand of tourist who wants to get away from everything without actually going to Canada or Alaska. They&#x2019;re mostly repeat customers, because there&#x2019;s something about this place. While they&#x2019;re here, they might go around the corner to Tahquamenon Falls, or all the way up to the Shipwreck Museum on Whitefish Point, stand there and look out at the vast expanse of water, maybe think about the <i>Edmund Fitzgerald</i> resting just a few miles out there, five hundred feet below the surface. Come back and spend some time at the Glasgow Inn. That&#x2019;s summer in Paradise. <br>I was at that very same Glasgow Inn that night. I was sitting at the bar, instead of my usual place in front of the fire, having given up my chair and the chair opposite to a couple from Wyandotte. They were staying in one of my cabins, and when they asked me where they should go to eat, I directed them here for Jackie&#x2019;s famous beef stew. After that and a couple of cocktails, they looked to be quite content, just sitting by the fire and looking at each other. <br>As for me, well&nbsp;&#x2026; There was nobody for me to look at. I had just felt the northern wind and had come in to inform Jackie that summer was on its last legs, something he never enjoyed hearing. Which might be why I always made a point of being the one to tell him. We have that kind of relationship, I guess. I bother him on a nightly basis, and in return he complains to me about everything in the world, including my own presence in his bar. <br>Oh, and once a week, he drives across the Internationl Bridge to bring me back a case of real Canadian Molson. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I can take another winter,&#x201d; he said to me, as he banged down one of those Molsons on the bar top. <br>&#x201c;You say that every year.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;This time, I mean it.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d been here in Paradise, Michigan going on thirty years now, and yet he still had that Scottish accent. He&#x2019;d tell you that he&#x2019;d lost it, of course, that he sounded just as American as I did. Just one more thing he was wrong about. <br>There was a television above the bar. The sound was off, but I was watching the Tigers play the Rangers. It was a home game, in what I still thought of as their brand-new ballpark, even though it had been a few years now. Comerica Park, one of those new-style parks that opened up into the city, showing off all of the downtown buildings I had once known so well. Three hundred miles from where I was sitting, and what felt like a thousand years ago. <br>&#x201c;I hear Arizona&#x2019;s nice,&#x201d; Jackie said. &#x201c;I hear it&#x2019;s <i>real</i> nice.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They have rattlesnakes there,&#x201d; I said, not taking my eyes off the television. &#x201c;And scorpions.&#x201d; <br>Jackie scoffed at that, but I could tell the idea had gotten to him. There weren&#x2019;t any rattlesnakes or scorpions crawling around when he was growing up in Glasgow, and as for Paradise&nbsp;&#x2026; Well, they might have a few eastern massasauga rattlesnakes downstate, but you&#x2019;d probably never find one in your bed up here. <br>&#x201c;Summer&#x2019;s supposed to last more than a goddamned month,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the part I just don&#x2019;t know if I can live with anymore.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I think we had double that this year. Besides, you <i>love</i> the winters up here.&#x201d; <br>He just stood there looking at me, bar towel in hand, like he was ready to smack me with it. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s cold as hell,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;it snows every day, and it lasts forever. What&#x2019;s not to like?&#x201d; <br>He shook his head, looking tired, like winter had already begun. <br>&#x201c;Seriously,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You love winter because you know this becomes the best place on earth. This bar, right over there by that fireplace.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;With your sorry backside parked in front of it every night, ordering me around. You&#x2019;re right, it doesn&#x2019;t get any better.&#x201d; <br>He looked over at the couple by the fireplace. <br>&#x201c;How old do you think those two are, anyway?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hell if I know.&#x201d; I turned to give them a quick once-over. &#x201c;Forty, maybe?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Forty years old and they&#x2019;re sitting there looking at each other like they&#x2019;re on their honeymoon.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Second honeymoon,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what they told me. They wanted to go to the most out-of-the-way place they could find without having to fly.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Which cabin do you have them in?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The last one. Now that I finally have it finished.&#x201d; Meaning rebuilt and refurnished, after somebody burned it down for me. <br>&#x201c;End of the line,&#x201d; he said, nodding his approval. &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t be a soul bothering them there.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sounding almost romantic, Jackie. Did you hit your head today?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Smartass.&#x201d; He turned away from me and started cleaning some glasses. This was the man who had survived the worst marriage in the history of mankind, to hear him tell it. Yet here he was, getting downright wistful at the sight of a man and a woman who were obviously married and didn&#x2019;t seem to hate each other. <br>Then it occurred to me. This was a bar in a town that saw its fair share of hunters in the fall, snowmobilers in the winter. Which means lots of men. Bird-watching had become the big thing in the spring lately, meaning mostly women. Then families in the summertime. A mom and a dad, yes, but also a couple of kids along to complain about how their cell phones don&#x2019;t work up here. The one sight you <i>don&#x2019;t</i> see too often in Paradise, Michigan is a moony-eyed couple, whether on their first honeymoon or their second. <br>The man caught my eye and raised his glass to me. I raised my bottle of Molson in return. <br>I&#x2019;d been married myself once. A long time ago, to a woman I met when I went to college after baseball. A woman I didn&#x2019;t have much in common with, aside from the &#x201c;Mc&#x201d; in our last names. Jeannie McDonald, who became Jeannie McKnight, who went back to being Jeannie McDonald again. Who may have then remarried and changed her name yet again. I&#x2019;m ashamed to say I don&#x2019;t even know if she did, or if she still lives in Michigan. If we had had children together, the story would be different, I&#x2019;m sure. Or if I ever paid a cent of alimony. At least that way I would have had an address to send checks to. As it was, she just left. Just walked away. I got the divorce papers in the mail, I signed them, I sent them back to her lawyer, and then we were done. <br>I wonder if she feels guilty. Wherever she is now, whoever she&#x2019;s with, I wonder if she looks back at the way she bailed out on me a few weeks after I got shot and has any regrets. <br>Hell, I wonder if I&#x2019;d even hold it against her now. I think I knew, way back when, that we&#x2019;d never last, shooting or no shooting. I think we both knew. <br>I sat there at the bar, looking at my bottle as the Tigers played in silence above my head. There&#x2019;d been a few women in that lost year after I left the force. Then I&#x2019;d come up to Paradise thinking I&#x2019;d sell off my father&#x2019;s cabins and had ended up staying here. Something about the place had spoken to me. Like this is where you really belong, mister. In the midst of these trees bending in the wind. On the shores of this cold lake. This stark lonely place on the edge of the world, which also turns into the most beautiful place on earth for the few days they call summer. <br>Then there was Sylvia, the wife of a rich man who thought I was his friend. Then Natalie, a cop from Ontario, someone who&#x2019;d lost her partner, just as I had. Someone who may or may not have turned out to be the right person for me, if I had ever gotten the chance to find out. <br>No. God damn it. No. <br>I put the bottle down. This is not where you want to be going tonight, I said to myself. This is not going to make you feel one little bit better about going back to that cabin alone. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s with you?&#x201d; Jackie said. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; <br>He narrowed his eyes at me like he wasn&#x2019;t buying it. Which made it feel like the right time to leave. A minute later I was outside in the cold night air, looking up at the stars and listening to the soft waves just behind the tree line. <br>I got in the truck and took the left turn down that old logging road, deep into the woods, passing my one neighbor&#x2019;s cabin. Vinnie Red Sky Leblanc, a blackjack dealer over at the Bay Mills Casino. He&#x2019;d gotten into some trouble, and I&#x2019;d been watching out for him. The lights were on at his place, and everything looked normal, so I gave him a honk and kept driving. My cabin was the first, the one I&#x2019;d helped my old man build back when I was eighteen years old and on my way to play Single-A ball. Back when I was young, stupid, and full of energy, and I didn&#x2019;t have a nine-millimeter slug sitting half a centimeter from my heart. <br>When I got inside, I saw the light flashing on the answering machine. I don&#x2019;t get a hell of a lot of calls. I hit the play button and listened to a voice from my distant past. <br>&#x201c;Hey, Alex McKnight! This is Tony Grimaldi. Remember me? I was a sergeant in the First Precinct, way the hell back when. I hope you&#x2019;re doing okay, and I hope you don&#x2019;t mind me calling you out of the blue. But I&#x2019;m really just making a courtesy call, and I&#x2019;d appreciate it if you could give me a call back.&#x201d; <br>He gave me his number. Then he signed off. <br>I stood there looking down at the machine, wondering why in God&#x2019;s name a desk sergeant from the old precinct would be calling me. I checked the time. I was in early, thanks to Jackie being an extra pain in the ass that night. So I figured what the hell, give the sergeant a call back. <br>I dialed the number, making note of the 734 area code. That was one of the new codes split off from the original 313. If you still had a 313, that meant you were either in Detroit or close enough to see it from your front door. <br>&#x201c;Alex, is that you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sergeant Grimaldi,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;How have you been, sir?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You can call me Tony now. I don&#x2019;t wear a badge anymore.&#x201d; <br>A half beat of silence then, as we skipped over my comeback. I wasn&#x2019;t wearing a badge anymore, either. I hadn&#x2019;t worn one in many years. <br>&#x201c;How long have you been out?&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s over ten years now. Hard to imagine. But most days I don&#x2019;t miss it much, to tell you the truth.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I hear ya.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nothing like it, of course. You know what I mean.&#x201d; <br>Another half beat. <br>&#x201c;I know what you mean,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re absolutely right. But how did you ever think to get hold of me after all this time?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, like I said in the message, it&#x2019;s just a courtesy call. I play golf with a few of the actives, and one of them happened to mention you. He was going to call you himself, but I told him I&#x2019;d love to catch up with you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Okay. Glad you did.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what I said, but it still wasn&#x2019;t making any sense. <br>&#x201c;I understand you&#x2019;re still drawing the disability, so obviously they had all of your contact information.&#x201d; <br>Disability. Not exactly my favorite word in the world, but I guess that&#x2019;s what you had to call it officially. When an officer gets shot on the job, he&#x2019;s eligible for two-thirds of his salary for the rest of his life. I don&#x2019;t make a point of telling most people that, because they&#x2019;ll inevitably look at me and try to see how it is I&#x2019;m supposedly disabled now. I mean, I can&#x2019;t raise my right arm all the way anymore. I can&#x2019;t throw a ball, which would have been more of a big deal back when I was a catcher, I realize, but not so much now. If you really pressed me, I&#x2019;d just have to tell you that I took three bullets and only two came out, and I&#x2019;m supposed to go get periodic X-rays to make sure that third bullet isn&#x2019;t migrating closer to my heart, at which point it could kill me. <br>I&#x2019;m supposed to go get those X-rays every year, but I don&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m supposed to feel guilt or gratitude or a mixture of both every time I get one of those checks in the mail, but I don&#x2019;t feel that, either. Mostly I just try to forget it ever happened. <br>&#x201c;So what did you have to tell me, Sergeant? I&#x2019;ve never gotten a courtesy call before.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I told you, call me Tony, please. But here&#x2019;s the deal. You remember a case you worked on, that last year you were on the force, where you ended up putting away a guy named Darryl King?&#x201d; <br>I was confused for exactly one second, because I never made detective and so technically I never really worked on a &#x201c;case.&#x201d; But as soon as I connected the name to the crime, it all came back to me. You don&#x2019;t see a crime scene like that without remembering it for the rest of your life. <br>&#x201c;Darryl King,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;In the train station.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You forgot &#x2018;With the knife.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sorry, bad joke. You know, like in that game? Colonel Mustard, in the library, with the lead pipe?&#x201d; <br>That&#x2019;s cop humor for you. A way to distance yourself from the most horrible crimes of all. A way to keep your sanity. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been away too long,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But seriously, why are we talking about Darryl King? Don&#x2019;t tell me he&#x2019;s getting out.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He is. Believe it or not.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That makes no sense. He drew a lot more time than that, didn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Tell me about it. But remember how he was, what, sixteen years old?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember exactly, but that sounds about right.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah, sixteen. Tried as an adult. It&#x2019;s been a real thing in the court lately, going back over those cases with youthful offenders.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Like what, we were supposed to just send him home with a warning because he was a minor? Stop killing people or we&#x2019;ll take away your allowance?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hey, I&#x2019;m just the messenger here, Alex. You&#x2019;re preaching to the choir.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sorry, it&#x2019;s just&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know, I know. Believe me. I&#x2019;ve seen a few other cases like that. Maybe not as bad as this one. Bottom line, the kid&#x2019;s spent his whole adult life in prison. I don&#x2019;t know where he&#x2019;s going to live, what he&#x2019;s gonna do, but I do know he&#x2019;ll be out in a few days. Not that I expect him to come looking for you or anything.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, probably not. Good luck finding me, even if he wanted to.&#x201d; <br>The sergeant laughed at that. &#x201c;Yeah, what, you&#x2019;re where, in Paradise? I gotta be honest, I had to look up where that is before I called you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long way from Detroit,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll have to watch my back.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, like I said, I don&#x2019;t expect this kid to do anything. I keep calling him a kid, I realize, and he&#x2019;s not a kid now. But you know what I mean. You just need to let people know.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I understand. So you called me&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And Detective Bateman, yes.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Wow, Arnie Bateman,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Another name I haven&#x2019;t heard in a long time.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah, he&#x2019;s off the force now, too. Left right around the same tim...</p><h2>Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Book One</h2><p><b>For nearly a decade, Geoff Johns was the primary architect of the Green Lantern universe.

It may be reasonably claimed that translations of the Qur'an are merely subjective attempts to render its meaning. Khan, a former Pakistani foreign minister and an international lawyer, presents a translation that is clear and simple to comprehend to a wide English-speaking audience. The Arabic text is included on the same page side by side with the English rendering. Divided into 114 chapters called "suras" and arranged in increasing order of length, the book contains the collected revelations of the Prophet Muhammad, transmitted to him by the Angel Gabriel. Khan's translation includes a lengthy introduction (about 50 pages) that sheds some light on what a lay reader should know about the Qur'an, according to the translator, and is meant in lieu of explanatory notes in single chapters. Recommended for all collections.?Ali Houissa, Cornell Univ., Ithaca, N.Y.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Reading English editions of the Qur'an was once a difficult undertaking for the non-specialist general reader, requiring copious explanatory notes to supplement the text. Muhammad Kahn's new translation of the Arabic text remains strictly faithful to the text in meaning, but is unique in its clarity and precision in English. The result is clearer comprehension and free-flowing text. The verses are not broken up, but are grouped into larger paragraphs combining a set of verses, all properly identified for ease of reference. This complete and accurate translations succeeds in making the study of the Qur'an broadly accessible to the English-speaking readership, with lasting value for beginning students, scholars, teachers, and anyone with an interest in learning more about the sacred scripture of Islam. Highly recommended. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>The Pursuit of Holiness (A Navigator Book)</h2><p>&#34;Be holy, for I am holy&#34;, commands God to His people. But holiness is something that is often missing in the Christian&#39;s daily life. In Pursuit of Holiness, Jerry Bridges explains how God has equipped us to lead holy lives, how reason and emotion influence our will, and how habits and personal discipline play a part in holy living.</p><p>What does holiness look like? For starters, it doesn&#39;t look anything like perfection. And it doesn&#39;t necessarily look like victory. Mostly, it consists of effort, prayer, grace, and obedience. &#34;Scripture speaks of both a holiness we have in Christ before God, and a holiness we are to strive after,&#34; writes the author. We can ignore neither Christ&#39;s role nor our own if we are to successfully pursue holiness. It is as simple as refusing to smudge the truth on a tax return or as complicated as forgiving the person who has most viciously hurt us. Jerry takes holiness out of the realm of the impossible and brings it into the real world of our daily lives and decisions.JERRY BRIDGES is an author and Bible teacher. His books include The Discipline of Grace, The Practice of Godliness, The Gospel for Real Life, and Growing Your Faith. Jerry and his wife, Jane, live in Colorado Springs, Colorado.<br><br>Alistair Begg is the senior pastor of Parkside Church in Cleveland, Ohio, and the author of five books, including Made for His Pleasure and Lasting Love.

The ultimate artists' artist and a great storyteller whose work is in turns haunting, hilarious, and spellbinding. Mike Mignola has won numerous awards in the comics industry and beyond. When strangeness threatens to engulf the world, a strange man will come to save it. Sent to investigate a mystery with supernatural overtones, Hellboy discovers the secrets of his own origins, and his link to the Nazi occultists who promised Hitler a final solution in the form of a demonic avatar.<br><br>" <i>Hellboy</i> is a passport to a corner of funnybook heaven you may never want to leave. "<br> &#x2014;Alan Moore, from his introduction.</p><p>The Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. Sound like something out of the <i>X-Files</i>? Well, it's one better; it's Hellboy, the world's greatest paranormal investigator. A mysteriously conjured demon, he's essentially a big red guy who goes looking for trouble. The catch is that he's not really the best investigator; let's face it, he's no Agent Mulder. But <i>Wake the Devil</i> always manages to maintain its creepy edge, in no small part due to Mignola's art, which may seem familiar. He did the set designs for Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula.<b>Mike Mignola's</b> fascination with ghosts and monsters began at an early age; reading <i>Dracula</i> at age twelve introduced him to Victorian literature and folklore, from which he has never recovered. Starting in 1982 as a bad inker for Marvel Comics, he swiftly evolved into a not-so-bad artist. By the late 1980s, he had begun to develop his own unique graphic style, with mainstream projects like <i>Cosmic Odyssey</i> and <i>Batman: Gotham by Gaslight</i>. In 1994, he published the first <i>Hellboy</i> series through Dark Horse. There are thirteen <i>Hellboy</i> graphic novels (with more on the way), several spin-off titles (<i>B.P.R.D., Lobster Johnson, Abe Sapien, </i>and<i> Sir Edward Grey: Witchfinder</i>), prose books, animated films, and two live-action films starring Ron Perlman. Along the way he worked on Francis Ford Coppola's film <i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i> (1992), was a production designer for Disney's<i> Atlantis: The Lost Empire</i> (2001), and was the visual consultant to director Guillermo del Toro on <i>Blade II</i> (2002), <i>Hellboy</i> (2004), and <i>Hellboy II: The Golden Army</i> (2008).

The answer lies in their cultural intelligence, or CQ. Packed with practical tools, research, and case studies, &#34;Leading with Cultural Intelligence&#34; breaks new ground, offering today&#39;s global workforce a specific, four-step model to becoming more adept at managing across cultures. Practical and insightful, this indispensable guide shows leaders how to connect across any cultural divide, including national, ethnic, and organizational cultures.</p><p><p> You&#x2019;ve gotten used to managing a diverse workforce. You deal with vendors across the globe. You see people as people, whether they&#x2019;re Chinese, Indian, Mexican, or American. You know the basic protocols to follow and the taboos to avoid. Still, when you arrive in another country or sit down to negotiate with someone from a different culture, you feel anxious and awkward, and often wind up saying or doing something wrong. You&#x2019;re not alone. Seventy percent of international ventures fail because of cultural differences. Do you need to speak multiple languages and have a Ph.D. in international relations to succeed in these global times? The reassuring reality is that you don&#x2019;t need to master all the norms and nuances of the myriad of cultures you encounter. What you need is CQ. That&#x2019;s short for Cultural Intelligence, a new set of skills and sensitivities that picks up where EQ leaves off. </p> <p> </p> <p> <i>Leading with Cultural Intelligence</i> is a ground�breaking guide to developing the repertoire and perspective to lead across a wide range of cultures&#x2014;effectively, respectfully, and confidently. A global leadership consultant, David Livermore presents a proven model for success in any unfamiliar cultural context. It&#x2019;s easy to grasp and follow, yet radically different from simplistic approaches that focus on mimicking other cultures&#x2019; gestures and phrases. Rooted in rigorous research spanning 25 countries, the CQ way of relating to and inspiring people from different national, ethnic, and organizational cultures is an ongoing cycle. You&#x2019;ll learn how to lead cross-culturally&#x2014;and continually grow in proficiency and comfort&#x2014;by applying a process with four key components: </p> <p> <b>Drive.</b> What&#x2019;s your motivation for this cross-cultural assignment? How can you increase your confidence level? </p> <p> <b>Knowledge.</b> What specific cultural systems, issues, and values do you need to understand? </p> <p> <b>Strategy.</b> What information do you need to map out a successful cross-cultural plan? What assumptions do you need to check? </p> <p> <b>Action.</b> What communication style and behaviors should you adapt for this intercultural interaction? </p> <p> </p> <p> At every step, you&#x2019;ll find helpful summaries and best practices. You&#x2019;ll also gain valuable insights into common situations, from eating unfamiliar local delicacies to apologizing, through the stories of frequent cross-cultural travelers. </p> <p> </p> <p> With <i>Leading with Cultural Intelligence</i> as your trusted compass, you&#x2019;ll be able to thrive in the global business climate and handle multi�cultural hurdles in your own backyard. By raising your CQ, you&#x2019;ll also contribute to the greater good of equal humanity for all. </p> <p> </p> <p> <b>David Livermore, Ph.D.</b>, is Executive Director of the Global Learning Center in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

But ten years have passed, and no girls have come forward. Now, however, someone is about to change all that. Her name is Kel. In this first book in a new series from popular children&#39;s fantasy writer Tamora Pierce, we are introduced to a strong, adventurous new heroine who will win the hearts and minds of fantasy fans.</p><p>In the sixth grade, Tamora Pierce was encouraged by her father to start writing and she immediately got hooked. Once she discovered fantasy and science fiction, she tried to write the same kind of stories she read, only with teenaged girl heroines who were usually missing from the 1960s stories. <br><br>Before her junior year at the University of Pennsylvania where she studied psychology, Pierce rediscovered writing when she wrote her first original short story since tenth grade. She sold her first story a year later and then enrolled in a fiction writing course during her senior year. When her teacher suggested that she tackle a novel, her childhood ideas came back to her and she began her first sword and sorcery novel. <br><br>Pierce then worked as a housemother in an Idaho group home for teenaged girls, who loved hearing Alanna&#x2019;s story from the in-progress quartet, Song of the Lioness. As Pierce continued to write and send out manuscripts, she moved to Manhattan to get her publishing career off the ground. <br><br>Pierce still lives in Manhattan with her husband, writer/filmmaker Tim, and their three cats, two parakeets, plus a floating population of rescued wildlife. She enjoys her hectic life as a full-time writer and she hopes that her books leave her readers with the feeling that they can achieve anything if they want it badly enough.<br><br>Tamora Pierce is a popular author of fantasy books for teenagers. In her latest quartet, Protector of the Small, readers follow heroine Kel as she rigorously trains for the knighthood.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i>Decisions<br><br>Alanna the Lioness, the Kino Champion, could hardly contain her glee. Baron Piers of Mindeldan had written to King Jonathan to say that his daughter wished to be a page. Alanna fought to sit still as she watched Wyldon of Cavall, the royal training master, read the barons letter. Seated across his desk from them, the king watched the trainig master as sharply as his Champion did. Lord Wyldon was known for his dislike of female warriors.<br><br>It had been ten long years since the proclamation that girls might attempt a page&#x2019;s training Alanna had nearly given up hope that such a girl- or the kind of family that would allow her to do so-,existed in Tortall, but at last she had come forward. Keladry of Mindelan would not have to hide her sex for eight years as Alanna had done. Keladry would prove to the world that girls could be knights. And she would not be friendless. Alanna had plans to help Keladry through the first few years. It never occurred to the Champion that anyone might object. <br><br>Alanna, half turned to see Wyldon better. Surely he'd read the letter at least twice! From this side the puffy scars from his battle to save the younger princes and princess were starkly visible; Wyldod&#x2019;s right arm was in a sling yet from that fight. Alanna rubbed fingers that itched with the urge to apply healing magic. Wyldon had the idea that suffering pain made a warrior stronger. He would not thank her if she tried to heal him now. <br><br>Goddess bless, she thought tiredly. How will I ever get on with him if I'm to help this girl Keladry? <br><br>Wyldon was not flexible: he'd proved that to the entire court over and over. If he were any stiffer, Alanna thought wryly, I&#x2019;d paint a design on him and use him for a shield. He's got no sense of humor and he rejects change just because it's change. <br><br>Still, she had to admit that his teaching worked. During the Immortals War of the spring and early summer, when legendary creatures had joined with the realm&#x2019;s human enemies to take the kingdom, the squires and pages had been forced into battle. They had done well, thanks to their training by Wyldon and the teachers he had picked. <br><br>At last Lord Wyldon returned the letter to King Jonathan, who placed it on his desk. "The baron and the baroness of Mindelan are faithful servants of the crown,&#x201d; the king remarked. &#x201c;We would not have this treaty with the Yamani Islands were it not for them. You will have read that their daughter received some warrior training at the Yamani court, so it would appear that Keladry has an aptitude." <br><br>Lord Wyldon resettled his arm in its sling. "I did not agree to this, Your Majesty." <br><br>Alanna was about to say that he didn&#x2019;t have to agree when she saw the king give the tiniest shake of the head. Clenching her jaws, she kept her remark to herself as King Jonathan raised his eyebrows. <br><br>"Your predecessor agreed," he reminded Wyldon. "And you, my lord, implied agreement when you accepted the post of training master." <br><br>"That is a lawyer's reply, sire,&#x201d; Wyldon replied stiffly, a slight flush rising in his cean-shaven cheeks. <br><br>"Then here is a king's: we desire this girl to train as a page." <br><br>And that is that, Alanna thought, satisfied. She might be the kind of knight who would argue with her king, at least in private, but Wyldon would never let himself do so. <br><br>The training master absently rubbed the arm in its linen sling. At last he bowed in his chair. "May we compromise, sire?" <br><br>Alanna stiffened. She hated that word! "Com---" she began to say. <br><br>The king silenced her with a look. "What do you want, my lord?" <br><br>"In all honesty," said the training master, thinking aloud, "I had thought that our noble parents loved their daughters too much to place them in so hard a life." <br><br>"Not everyone is afraid to do anything new," Alanna replied sharply. <br><br>"Lioness," said the king, his voice dangerously quiet. Alanna clenched her fists. What was going on? Was Jonathan inclined to give way to the man who'd saved his children? <br><br>Wyldon's eyes met hers squarely. "Your bias is known, Lady Alanna." To the king he said, "Surely the girl's parents cannot be aware of the difficulties she will encounter." <br><br>"Baron Piers and Lady Ilane are not fools&#x201d; replied King Jonathan. "They have given us three good, worthy knights already," <br><br>Lord Wyldon gave a reluctant nod. Anders, Inness, and Conal of Mindelan were credits to their training. The realm would feel the loss of Anders-whose war wounds could never heal entirely-from the active duty rolls. It would take years to replace those who were killed or maimed in the Immortals War. <br><br>"Sire, please, think this through,&#x201d; Wyldon said. "We need the realm&#x2019;s sons. Girls are fragile, more emotional, easier to frighten. They are not as strong in their arms and shoulders as men. They tire easily. This girl would get any warriors who serve with her killed on some dark night.<br><br>Alanna started to get up. This time King Jonathan walked out from behind his desk. Standing beside his Champion, he gripped one of her shoulders, keeping her in her chair. <br><br>".But I will be fair," Wyldon continued. His brown eyes were hard. &#x201c;Let her be on probation for a year. By the end of the summer field camp, if she has not convinced me of her ability to keep up, she must go home." <br><br>"Who judges her fitness?" inquired the king. <br><br>Wyldon&#x2019;s lips tightened. "Who but the training master, sire? I have the most experience in evaluating the young for their roles as future knights." <br><br>Alanna turned to stare at the king. "No boy has ever undergone a probationary period!" she cried. <br><br>Wyldon raised his good shoulder in a shrug. "Perhaps they should. For now, I will not tender my resignation over this, provided I judge whether this girl stays or goes in one year's time." <br><br>The king weighed the request. Alanna fidgeted. She knew Lord Wyldon meant his threat, and the crown needed him. Too many great nobles, dismayed by the changes in Tortall. since Jonathan&#x2019;s coronation, felt that Wyldon was their voice at court. If he resigned, the king and queen would find it hard to get support for their future changes. <br><br>At last King Jonathan said, "Though we do not always agree, my lord, you know I respect you because you are fair and honorable. I would hate to see that fairness, that honor, tainted in any way. Keladry of Mindelan shall have a year's probation."<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Trees (National Audubon Society First Field Guide)</h2><p>A visual guide to the natural science of trees as well as a field guide to the trees found in the United States and Canada</p><p>Grade 4-8-Behler begins with an overview of characteristics applicable to all reptiles. Next, individual North American species are organized into four groups: crocodilians, turtles, lizards, and snakes. Clear, full-color photographs and short capsules of information make it easy to identify each animal and its relatives. The introduction in Trees addresses the characteristics of different North American types, which are then categorized by the shape of their leaves. However, not all trees with the same type of leaves are grouped together, making this title more difficult to use than Reptiles. In addition, some of the photographs are so small that it is impossible to use them for identification purposes. Both books include warnings if an animal or plant is considered harmful.

Best friend <b>Lucy Greeves</b>, a freelance writer, met Jimmy while they were students at Cambridge University.*Starred Review* It's hard to talk about comedy without sounding, at least part of the time, like a humorless pedant: see Freud's <i>Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious</i>. But it isn't impossible, as British comedians Carr (host of the Comedy Central game show <i>Distractions</i>) and Greeves prove in their lively, intelligent, highly readable, often hilarious coverage of all aspects of what makes people laugh--at least, in the English-speaking world. (Carr and Greeves carefully point out that humor is culturally based, and what is hilarious to one culture may merely baffle another.) Specific topics include why we need to laugh, the role joking plays in society, what kind of people become professional comedians, and the ever-changing standards for what kind of jokes go too far. American readers, used to the knee-jerk anti-intellectualism of most U.S. comics, may be surprised and delighted by how comfortably Carr and Greeves, both graduates of Cambridge University, discuss the most high-flown theories of comedy. Then again, many of the best British comics of the last two generations, such as Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, and the Monty Python crew, have had strong academic credentials. And never fear, the book is packed with jokes, many of them by professional stand-ups, most of them absolute howlers, that illustrate Carr and Greeves' arguments. <i>Jack Helbig</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

We&#x2019;d completed our first full week outside in the piazza &#x2014; a relief, let me tell you, after all those stuffy hours performing from the back of the cafe, getting in the way of customers wanting to use the staircase. There was quite a breeze that morning, and our brand-new marquee was flapping all around us, but we were all feeling a little bit brighter and fresher, and I guess it showed in our music.<br><br>But here I am talking like I&#x2019;m a regular band member. Actually, I&#x2019;m one of the &#x2018;gypsies&#x2019;, as the other musicians call us, one of the guys who move around the piazza, helping out whichever of the three cafe orchestras needs us. Mostly I play here at the Caff� Lavena, but on a busy afternoon, I might do a set with the Quadri boys, go over to the Florian, then back across the square to the Lavena. I get on fine with them all &#x2014; and with the waiters too &#x2014; and in any other city I&#x2019;d have a regular position by now. But in this place, so obsessed with tradition and the past, everything&#x2019;s upside down. Anywhere else, being a guitar player would go in a guy&#x2019;s favour. But here? A guitar! The caf� won&#x2019;t like it. Last autumn I got myself a vintage jazz model with an oval sound-hole, the kind of thing Django Reinhardt might have played, so there was no way anyone would mistake me for a rock-and-roller. That made things a little easier, but the cafe managers, they still don&#x2019;t like it. The truth is, if you&#x2019;re a guitarist, you can be Joe Pass, they still wouldn&#x2019;t give you a regular job in this square.<br><br>There&#x2019;s also, of course, the small matter of my not being Italian, never mind Venetian. It&#x2019;s the same for that big Czech guy with the alto sax. We&#x2019;re well liked, we&#x2019;re needed by the other musicians, but we don&#x2019;t quite fit the official bill. Just play and keep your mouth shut, that&#x2019;s what the cafe managers always say. That way the tourists won&#x2019;t know you&#x2019;re not Italian. Wear your suit, sunglasses, keep the hair combed back, no one will know the difference, just don&#x2019;t start talking.<br><br>But I don&#x2019;t do too bad. All three cafe orchestras, especially when they have to play at the same time from their rival tents, they need a guitar &#x2014; something soft, solid, but amplified, thumping out the chords from the back. I guess you&#x2019;re thinking, three bands playing at the same time in the same square, that would sound like a real mess. But the Piazza San Marco&#x2019;s big enough to take it. A tourist strolling across the square will hear one tune fade out, another fade in, like he&#x2019;s shifting the dial on a radio. What tourists can&#x2019;t take too much of is the classical stuff, all these instrumental versions of famous arias. Okay, this is San Marco, they don&#x2019;t want the latest pop hits. But every few minutes they want something they recognise, maybe an old Julie Andrews number, or the theme from a famous movie. I remember once last summer, going from band to band and playing &#x2018;The Godfather&#x2019; nine times in one afternoon.<br><br>Anyway there we were that spring morning, playing in front of a good crowd of tourists, when I saw Tony Gardner, sitting alone with his coffee, almost directly in front of us, maybe six metres back from our marquee. We get famous people in the square all the time, we never make a fuss. At the end of a number, maybe a quiet word will go around the band members. Look, there&#x2019;s Warren Beatty. Look, it&#x2019;s Kissinger. That woman, she&#x2019;s the one who was in the movie about the men who swap their faces. We&#x2019;re used to it. This is the Piazza San Marco after all. But when I realised it was Tony Gardner sitting there, that was different. I <i>did </i>get excited.<br><br>Tony Gardner had been my mother&#x2019;s favourite. Back home, back in the communist days, it had been really hard to get records like that, but my mother had pretty much his whole collection. Once when I was a boy, I scratched one of those precious records. The apartment was so cramped, and a boy my age, you just had to move around sometimes, especially during those cold months when you couldn&#x2019;t go outside. So I was playing this game jumping from our little sofa to the armchair, and one time I misjudged it and hit the record player. The needle went across the record with a zip &#x2014; this was long before CDs &#x2014; and my mother came in from the kitchen and began shouting at me. I felt so bad, not just because she was shouting at me, but because I knew it was one of Tony Gardner&#x2019;s records, and I knew how much it meant to her. And I knew that this one too would now have those popping noises going through it while he crooned those American songs. Years later, when I was working in Warsaw and I got to know about black-market records, I gave my mother replacements of all her worn-out Tony Gardner albums, including that one I scratched. It took me over three years, but I kept getting them, one by one, and each time I went back to see her I&#x2019;d bring her another.<br><br>So you see why I got so excited when I recognised him, barely six metres away. At first I couldn&#x2019;t quite believe it, and I might have been a beat late with a chord change. Tony Gardner! What would my dear mother have said if<br>she&#x2019;d known! For her sake, for the sake of her memory, I had to go and say something to him, never mind if the other musicians laughed and said I was acting like a bellboy.<br><br>But of course I couldn&#x2019;t just rush over to him, pushing aside the tables and chairs. There was our set to finish. It was agony, I can tell you, another three, four numbers, and every second I thought he was about to get up and walk off. But he kept sitting there, by himself, staring into his coffee, stirring it like he was really puzzled by what the waiter had brought him. He looked like any other American tourist, dressed in a pale-blue polo shirt and loose grey trousers. His hair, very dark, very shiny on those record covers, was almost white now, but there was still plenty of it, and it was immaculately groomed in the same style he&#x2019;d had back then. When I&#x2019;d first spotted him, he&#x2019;d had his dark glasses in his hand &#x2014; I doubt if I&#x2019;d have recognised him otherwise &#x2014; but as our set went on and I kept watching him, he put them on his face, took them off again, then back on again. He looked preoccupied and it disappointed me to see he wasn&#x2019;t really listening to our music.<br><br>Then our set was over. I hurried out of the tent without saying anything to the others, made my way to Tony Gardner&#x2019;s table, then had a moment&#x2019;s panic not knowing how to start the conversation. I was standing behind him, but some sixth sense made him turn and look up at me &#x2014; I guess it was all those years of having fans come up to him &#x2014; and next thing I was introducing myself, explaining how much I admired him, how I was in the band he&#x2019;d just been listening to, how my mother had been such a fan, all in one big rush. He listened with a grave expression, nodding every few seconds like he was my doctor. I kept talking and all he said every now and then was: &#x2018;Is that so?&#x2019; After a while I thought it was time to leave and I&#x2019;d started to move away when he said:<br><br>&#x2018;So you come from one of those communist countries. That must have been tough.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s all in the past.&#x2019; I did a cheerful shrug. &#x2018;We&#x2019;re a free country now. A democracy.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s good to hear. And that was your crew playing for us just now. Sit down. You want some coffee?&#x2019;<br><br>I told him I didn&#x2019;t want to impose, but there was now something gently insistent about Mr Gardner. &#x2018;No, no, sit down. Your mother liked my records, you were saying.&#x2019;<br><br>So I sat down and told him some more. About my mother, our apartment, the black-market records. And though I couldn&#x2019;t remember what the albums were called, I started describing the pictures on their sleeves the way I remembered them, and each time I did this, he&#x2019;d put his finger up in the air and say something like: &#x2018;Oh, that would be <i>Inimitable</i>. <i>The Inimitable Tony Gardner</i>.&#x2019; I think we were both really enjoying this game, but then I noticed Mr Gardner&#x2019;s gaze move off me, and I turned just in time to see a woman coming up to our table.<br><br>She was one of those American ladies who are so classy, with great hair, clothes and figure, you don&#x2019;t realise they&#x2019;re not so young until you see them up close. Far away, I might have mistaken her for a model out of those glossy fashion magazines. But when she sat down next to Mr Gardner and pushed her dark glasses onto her forehead, I realised she must be at least fifty, maybe more. Mr Gardner said to me: &#x2018;This is Lindy, my wife.&#x2019;<br><br>Mrs Gardner flashed me a smile that was kind of forced, then said to her husband: &#x2018;So who&#x2019;s this? You&#x2019;ve made yourself a friend.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s right, honey. I was having a good time talking here with . . . I&#x2019;m sorry, friend, I don&#x2019;t know your name.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Jan,&#x2019; I said quickly. &#x2018;But friends call me Janeck.&#x2019;<br><br>Lindy Gardner said: &#x2018;You mean your nickname&#x2019;s longer than your real name? How does that work?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t be rude to the man, honey.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m not being rude.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t make fun of the man&#x2019;s name, honey. That&#x2019;s a good girl.&#x2019;<br><br>Lindy Gardner turned to me with a helpless sort of expression. &#x2018;You know what he&#x2019;s talking about? Did I insult you?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;No, no,&#x2019; I said, &#x2018;not at all, Mrs Gardner.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;He&#x2019;s always telling me I&#x2019;m rude to the public. But I&#x2019;m not rude. Was I rude to you just now?&#x2019; Then to Mr Gardner: &#x2018;I speak to the public in a <i>natural </i>way, sweetie. It&#x2019;s <i>my </i>way. I&#x2019;m never rude.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Okay, honey,&#x2019; Mr Gardner said, &#x2018;let&#x2019;s not make a big thing of it. Anyhow, this man here, he&#x2019;s not the public.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Oh, he&#x2019;s not? Then what is he? A long-lost nephew?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Be nice, honey. This man, he&#x2019;s a colleague. A musician, a pro. He&#x2019;s just been entertaining us all.&#x2019; He gestured towards our marquee.<br><br>&#x2018;Oh right!&#x2019; Lindy Gardner turned to me again. &#x2018;You were playing up there just now? Well, that was pretty. You were on the accordion, right? Real pretty!&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Thank you very much. Actually, I&#x2019;m the guitarist.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Guitarist? You&#x2019;re kidding me. I was watching you only a minute ago. Sitting right there, next to the double bass man, playing so beautifully on your accordion.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Pardon me, that was in fact Carlo on the accordion. The big bald guy . . .&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Are you sure? You&#x2019;re not kidding me?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Honey, I&#x2019;ve told you. Don&#x2019;t be rude to the man.&#x2019;<br><br>He hadn&#x2019;t shouted exactly, but his voice was suddenly hard and angry, and now there was a strange silence. Then Mr Gardner himself broke it, saying gently:<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry, honey. I didn&#x2019;t mean to snap at you.&#x2019;<br><br>He reached out a hand and grasped one of hers. I&#x2019;d kind of expected her to shake him off, but instead, she moved in her chair so she was closer to him, and put her free hand over their clasped pair. They sat there like that for a few seconds, Mr Gardner, his head bowed, his wife gazing emptily past his shoulder, across the square towards the Basilica, though her eyes didn&#x2019;t seem to be seeing anything. For those few moments it was like they&#x2019;d forgotten not just me sitting with them, but all the people in the piazza. Then she said, almost in a whisper:<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s okay, sweetie. It was my fault. Getting you all upset.&#x2019;<br><br>They went on sitting like that a little longer, their hands locked. Then she sighed, let go of Mr Gardner and looked at me. She&#x2019;d looked at me before, but this time it was different. This time I could feel her charm. It was like she had this dial, going zero to ten, and with me, at that moment, she&#x2019;d decided to turn it to six or seven, but I could feel it really strong, and if she&#x2019;d asked some favour of me &#x2014; if say she&#x2019;d asked me to go across the square and buy her some flowers &#x2014; I&#x2019;d have done it happily.<br><br>&#x2018;Janeck,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s your name, right? I&#x2019;m sorry, Janeck. Tony&#x2019;s right. I&#x2019;d no business speaking to you the way I did.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Mrs Gardner, really, please don&#x2019;t worry . . .&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;And I disturbed the two of you talking. Musicians&#x2019; talk, I bet. You know what? I&#x2019;m gonna leave the two of you to get on with it.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;No reason to go, honey,&#x2019; Mr Gardner said.<br><br>&#x2018;Oh yes there is, sweetie. I&#x2019;m absolutely <i>yearning </i>to go look in that Prada store. I only came over just now to tell you I&#x2019;d be longer than I said.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Okay, honey.&#x2019; Tony Gardner straightened for the first time and took a deep breath. &#x2018;So long as you&#x2019;re sure you&#x2019;re happy doing that.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m gonna have a fantastic time in that store. So you two fellas, you have yourselves a good talk.&#x2019; She got to her feet and touched me on the shoulder. &#x2018;You take care, Janeck.&#x2019;<br><br>We watched her walk away, then Mr Gardner asked me a few things about being a musician in Venice, and about the Quadri orchestra in particular, who&#x2019;d started playing just at that moment. He didn&#x2019;t seem to listen so carefully to my answers and I was about to excuse myself and leave, when he said suddenly:<br><br>&#x2018;There&#x2019;s something I want to put to you, friend. Let me tell you what&#x2019;s on my mind and you can turn me down if that&#x2019;s what you want.&#x2019; He leaned forward and lowered his voice. &#x2018;Can I tell you something? The first time Lindy and I came here to Venice, it was our honeymoon. Twenty-seven years ago. And for all our happy memories of this place, we&#x2019;d never been back, not together anyway. So when we were planning this trip, this special trip of ours, we said to ourselves we&#x2019;ve got to spend a few days in Venice.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s your anniversary, Mr Gardner?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Anniversary?&#x2019; He looked startled.<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x2019; I said. &#x2018;I just thought, because you said this was your special trip.&#x2019;<br><br>He went on looking startled for a while, then he laughed, a big, booming laugh, and suddenly I remembered this particular song my mother used to play all the time where he does a talking passage in the middle of the song, something about not caring that this woman has left him, and he does this sardonic laugh. Now the same laugh was booming across the square. Then he said:<br><br>&#x2018;Anniversary? No, no, it&#x2019;s not our anniversary. But what I&#x2019;m proposing, it&#x2019;s not so far off. Because I want to do something very romantic. I want to serenade her. Properly, Venice style. That&#x2019;s where you come in. You play your guitar, I sing. We do it from a gondola, we drift under the window, I sing up to her. We&#x2019;re renting a palazzo not far from here. The bedroom window looks over the canal. After dark, it&#x2019;ll be perfect. The lamps on the walls light things up just right. You and me in a gondola, she comes to the window. All her favourite numbers. We don&#x2019;t need to do it for long, the evenings are still kinda chilly. Just three or four songs, that&#x2019;s what I have in mind. I&#x2019;ll see you&#x2019;re well compensated. What do you say?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Mr Gardner, I&#x2019;d be absolutely honoured. As I told you, you&#x2019;ve been an important figure for me. When were you thinking of doing this?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;If it doesn&#x2019;t rain, why not tonight? Around eight-thirty? We eat dinner early, so we&#x2019;ll be back by then. I&#x2019;ll make some excuse, leave the apartment, come and meet you. I&#x2019;ll have a gondola fixed up, we&#x2019;ll come back along the canal, stop under the window. It&#x2019;ll be perfect. What do you say?&#x2019;<br><br>You can probably imagine, this was like a dream come true. And besides, it seemed such a sweet idea, this couple &#x2014; he in his sixties, she in her fifties &#x2014; behaving like teenagers in love. In fact it was so sweet an idea it almost, but not quite, made me forget the scene I&#x2019;d just witnessed between them. What I mean is, even at that stage, I knew deep down that things wouldn&#x2019;t be as straightforward as he was making out.<br><br>For the next few minutes Mr Gardner and I sat there discussing all the details &#x2014; which songs he wanted, the keys he preferred, all those kinds of things. Then it was time for me to get back to the marquee and our next set, so I stood up, shook his hand and told him he could absolutely count ...</p><h2>The Man Who Listens to Horses</h2><p>&#34;It all dates from those summers alone in the high desert, me lying on my belly and watching wild horses with my binoculars for hours at a time. Straining to see in the moonlight, striving to fathom mustang ways, I knew instinctively I had chanced upon something important but could not know that it would shape my life. In 1948 I was a boy of thirteen learning the language of horses. . . .&#34;</p><p>Monty Roberts is, as they say, the <i>real</i> horse whisperer--even if he does revile the last third of Nicholas Evans's romance. Yet Roberts also makes clear from the start that listening and close attention have more to do with gentling an animal than soi-disant whispering. As far as he's concerned, silent communication can "effectively cross over the boundary between human (the ultimate fight animal) and horse (the flight animal). Using their language, their system of communication, I could create a strong bond of trust. I would achieve cross-species communication." And achieve it he does. After one short session, he has even the wildest stallion nickering with ungulate abandon. <p> Roberts's descriptions of "joining up," as he calls it with horses--as well as with the deer who cavort on his California farm like so many hyperintelligent Bambis--are inspirational in the best sense of the word. Surprisingly, though, it took him long years to persuade most of the humans in his life that pain and punishment are not the way to go. Indeed, the author expends many a page on past mistakes and disasters, familial and professional. Yet <i>The Man Who Listens to Horses</i> remains a powerfully positive document--and not just for Mr. Ed. Best of all, when it comes to his life's work, Roberts is far more practical than mystical. Instead of portraying himself as Equus's messiah, he'd rather share his hard-won knowledge. Having overcome years of rejection and ridicule, the author is certainly not short in the self-esteem department, as some passages in this book demonstrate. No matter. He always checks his ego before entering the corral. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"His portrait of the business of breeding and training horses is frank and fascinating, but the book's most memorable passages cover rodeos and horse business in the west as it was in the author's youth, and include a haunting portrait of his violent, racist father and some of the other remarkable figures Roberts knew (including a young James Dean). Over and above everything, though, is Roberts' surpassing love for horses, captured here in his evocations of the horses he has trained over a career spanning four decades."<br>--<b>Kirkus Reviews</b><p>"This book is important reading for those interested in communication, particularly interspecies communication and linguistics."<br>--<b>Publisher's Weekly</b></p><p>"Monty Roberts' book <b>The Man Who Listens to Horses</b> has inspired me to the depths of my soul.

This book is about a man to whom all of it points, the greatest conspiracist of this generation and a man you may not have heard of.<br><br> A former U.S. naval intelligence worker, Milton William Cooper published his manifesto <i>Behold a Pale Horse</i> in 1991. Since then it has gone on to sell hundreds of thousands of copies, becoming the number-one bestseller in the American prison system. According to <i>Behold a Pale Horse</i>, JFK was assassinated&#x2014;because he was about to reveal that extraterrestrials were about to take over the earth&#x2014;by his driver, an alien himself; AIDS is a government conspiracy to decrease the population of blacks, Hispanics, and homosexuals; and the Illuminati are secretly involved with the U.S. government to manage relationships with extraterrestrials. Cooper died in a shootout with Apache County police in 2001, one month after September 11, in the year in which he had predicted catastrophe.<br><br> In <i>Pale Horse Rider</i>, journalist Mark Jacobson not only tells the story of Cooper&#x2019;s fascinating life but also provides the social and political context for American paranoia. Indeed, with the present NSA situation and countless other shadowy government dealings often in the news, aren&#x2019;t we right to suspect that things may not be as they seem?</p><p><b>Mark Jacobson</b> is a writer and journalist based in Brooklyn, New York.

My name is Luke."<br><br>He was sure no one could hear. His roommates were all asleep, and even if they weren't, there was no way the sound of his name could travel even the short distance to the bed above or beside him. He was fairly certain there were no bugs on him or in his room. He'd looked. But even if he'd missed seeing a microphone hidden in a mattress button or carved into the headboard, how could a microphone pick up a whisper he could barely hear himself?<br><br>He was safe now. Lying in bed, wide awake while everyone else slept, he reassured himself of that fact constantly. But his heart pounded and his face went clammy with fear every time he rounded his lips for that "u" sound -- instead of the fake smile of the double "e" in Lee, the name he had to force himself to answer to now.<br><br>It was better to forget, to never speak his real name again.<br><br>But he'd lost everything else. Even just mouthing his name was a comfort. It seemed like his only link now to his past, to his parents, his brothers.<br><br>To Jen.<br><br>By day, he kept his mouth shut.<br><br>He couldn't help it.<br><br>That first day, walking up the stairs of the Hendricks School for Boys with Jen's father, Luke had felt his jaw clench tighter and tighter the closer he got to the front door.<br><br>"Oh, don't look like that," Mr. Talbot had said, pretending to be jolly. "It's not reform school or anything."<br><br>The word stuck in Luke's brain. Reform. Re-form. Yes, they were going to re-form him. They were going to take a Luke and make him a Lee.<br><br>It was safe to be Lee. It wasn't safe to be Luke.<br><br>Jen's father stood with his hand on the ornate doorknob, waiting for a reply. But Luke couldn't have said a word if his life depended on it.<br><br>Jen's father hesitated, then pulled on the heavy door. They walked down a long hallway. The ceiling was so far away, Luke thought he could have stood his entire family on his shoulders -- one on top of the other, Dad and Mother and Matthew and Mark -- and the highest one still would barely touch. The walls were lined, floor to ceiling, with old paintings of people in costumes Luke had never seen outside of books.<br><br>Of course, there was very little he'd ever seen outside of books.<br><br>He tried not to stare, because if he really were Lee, surely everything would look familiar and ordinary. But that was hard to remember. They passed a classroom where dozens of boys sat in orderly rows, everyone facing away from the door. Luke gawked for so long that he practically began walking backwards. He'd known there were a lot of people in the world, but he'd never been able to imagine so many all in one place at the same time. Were any of them shadow children with fake identities, like Luke?<br><br>Jen's father clapped a hand on his shoulder, turning him around.<br><br>"Ah, here's the headmaster's office," Mr. Talbot said heartily. "Just what we were looking for."<br><br>Luke nodded, still mute, and followed him through a tall doorway.<br><br>A woman sitting behind a mammoth wood desk turned their way. She took one look at Luke and asked, "New boy?"<br><br>"Lee Grant," Jen's father said. "I spoke with the master about him last night."<br><br>"It's the middle of the semester, you know," she said warningly. "Unless he's very well prepared, he shan't catch up, and might have to repeat -- "<br><br>"That won't be a problem," Mr. Talbot assured her. Luke was glad he didn't have to speak for himself. He knew he wasn't well prepared. He wasn't prepared for anything.<br><br>The woman was already reaching for files and papers.<br><br>"His parents faxed in his medical information and his insurance standing and his academic records last night," she said. "But someone needs to sign these -- "<br><br>Jen's father took the stack of papers as if he autographed other people's documents all the time.<br><br>Probably he did.<br><br>Luke watched Mr. Talbot flip through the papers, scrawling his name here, crossing out a word or a phrase or a whole paragraph there. Luke was sure Jen's father was going too fast to actually read any of it.<br><br>And that was when the homesickness hit Luke for the first time. He could just picture his own father peering cautiously at important papers, reading them over and over before he even picked up a pen. Luke could see his father's rheumy eyes squinted in concentration, his brow furrowed with anxiety.<br><br>He was always so afraid of being tricked.<br><br>Maybe Jen's father didn't care.<br><br>Luke had to swallow hard then. He made a gulping noise, and the woman looked at him. Luke couldn't read her expression. Curiosity? Contempt? Indifference?<br><br>He didn't think it was sympathy.<br><br>Jen's father finished then, handing the papers back to the woman with a flourish.<br><br>"I'll call a boy to show you your room," the woman said to Luke.<br><br>Luke nodded. The woman leaned over a box on her desk and said, "Mr. Dirk, could you send Rolly Sturgeon to the office?"<br><br>Luke heard a roar along with the man's reply, "Yes, Ms. Hawkins," as if all the boys in the school were laughing and cheering and hissing at once. Luke felt his legs go weak with fear. When this Rolly Sturgeon showed up, Luke wasn't sure he'd be able to walk.<br><br>"Well, I'll be off," Jen's father said. "Duty calls."<br><br>He stuck out his hand and after a moment Luke realized he was supposed to shake it. But he'd never shaken hands with anyone before, so he put out the wrong hand first. Jen's father frowned, moving his head violently side to side, and glaring pointedly at the woman behind the desk. Fortunately, she wasn't watching. Luke recovered. He clumsily touched his hand to Jen's father's.<br><br>"Good luck," Jen's father said, bringing his other hand up to Luke's, too.<br><br>Only when Mr. Talbot had pulled both hands away did Luke realize he'd placed a tiny scrap of paper between Luke's fingers. Luke held it there until the woman turned her back. Then he slid it into his pocket.<br><br>Jen's father smiled.<br><br>"Keep those grades up," he said. "And no running away this time, you hear?"<br><br>Luke gulped again, and nodded. And then Jen's father left without a backward glance.<br><br>Copyright � 2001 by Margaret Peterson Haddix</p><h2>Sarah, Plain and Tall</h2><p>Special Edition: Includes an aftwerword to you from Patricia MacLachlan.

Father Arseny, former scholar of church art, became Prisoner No. 18736 in the brutal &#39;special sector&#39; of the Soviet prison camp system. In the darkness of systematic degradation of body and soul, he shone with the light of Christ&#39;s peace and compassion. His sights set on God and his life grounded in the Church, Father Arseny lived by injunction to &#39;bear one another&#39;s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ&#39; (Galatians 6:2). This narrative, compiled from accounts of Father Arseny&#39;s spiritual children and others whom he brought to God, gives stirring glimpses of his life in prison camp and after his release. It also tells the stories of people whose lives, often during times of almost unimaginable crisis, were touched and transfigured through their connection with Father Arseny. Emerging from the context of the particular tragedies of Soviet Russia, this book carries a universal impact certain to be felt by readers in the West today.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Deliverance (Defiance Trilogy, 3)</h2><p><p>The thrilling final installment of C.J.

But many churches tend to be extroverted places where introverts are marginalized. Some Christians end up feeling like it's not as faithful to be an introvert. Adam McHugh shows how introverts can live and minister in ways consistent with their personalities. He explains how introverts and extroverts process information and approach relationships differently and how introverts can practice Christian spirituality in ways that fit who they are. With practical illustrations from church and parachurch contexts, McHugh offers ways for introverts to serve, lead, worship and even evangelize effectively. <em>Introverts in the Church</em> is essential reading for any introvert who has ever felt out of place, as well as for church leaders who want to make their churches more welcoming to introverts. Discover God's call and empowering to thrive as an introvert, for the sake of the church and kingdom.</p><p>Adam S. McHugh (ThM, Princeton Theological Seminary) is an ordained Presbyterian minister and spiritual director, and a regular contributor to Susan Cain&#x2019;s Quiet Revolution website. He has served at two Presbyterian churches, as a hospice chaplain and as campus staff with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. He is the author of <em>The Listening Life</em>, which won the 2017&nbsp;<em>Christianity Today</em>&nbsp;Book Award for spiritual formation, and <em>Introverts in the Church</em>, and lives on the central coast of California."This is a timely and badly needed book which will encourage thousands of Christians who have felt they don't quite fit in. This book gave me hope that it was okay to doubt and be uncomfortable in some settings and group styles." (Jan Arkills, The Lamplighter)<br><br>A mixture of biblically grounded psychology, examples from Scripture, personal anecdotes, and practical advice on how to reach out to introverts as well as what to do if you're the Introvert in ministry. His goal is to show that introverts and extroverts alike have a place in the church despite how they handle relationships and process information. (Rachel Lonas, Pulpit Helps, December 2009)<br><br>Any introverted Christian who ever has felt misunderstood because of his or her personality type likely will find this book a revelatory, mission-affirming reading experience. (Todd Hoover, Youth Worker Journal, January/February 2010)<br><br>McHugh challenges churches to recognize that the significant numbers of introverts in their bodies have been gifted to serve in unique ways and to encourage them and open up avenues for service. (Pulpit Helps, November 2009)<br><br>Full-time and lay ministers within churches will enjoy reading this book to understand better the struggles and strengths introverts can bring to church ministry. Highly recommended. (Ray Arnett, Library Journal, November 1, 2009)<br><br>With clarity, logic, practical examples, and scripture <em>Introverts in the Church</em> offers ways for more reticent types to effectively serve, lead, worship, and share their faith with some helpful advice to the terminally introverted on how to be more involved in the world outside themselves. <em>Introverts</em> offers hope and reveals how more restrained people can approach relationships differently and practice spirituality in ways that fit who they are. (Jim Miller, Jim Miller Book Review, November 25, 2009)<br><br>"For the longest time, I've considered my wiring as an introvert a thorn in my side. After spending time engaging with others, I felt so empty and overwhelmed . . . and lonely. With my calling as an author and pastor requiring me to publicly speak and consult, I wondered if I misunderstood my place in this world. In <em>Introverts in the Church,</em> Adam brings a voice to those of us who often trade ours in for a little bit of respite. This is not only a needed resource for introverts; all leaders need to read <em>Introverts in the Church</em> for a better understanding of how introverts can lead, how they follow and how they refresh." (Anne Marie Miller, pastor, blogger and author of Mad Church Disease: Overcoming the Burnout Epidemic)<br><br>"As an author and consultant, I have seen firsthand the struggles that introverts face in a society built for extroverts. But I have also seen how powerful introverts can be once they embrace the gifts of a quiet and thoughtful temperament. In this deeply felt and beautifully reasoned guide for introverts in the church, pastor Adam McHugh shows the way for introverted Christians to find peace within themselves and their community." (Susan Cain, author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking)<br><br>"As an introvert who has experienced both the strengths and weaknesses of my temperament, I appreciate the way McHugh goes well beyond the facile stereotypes and conclusions of armchair psychologists. If you've ever felt vaguely sinful for not being a gregarious Christian I suggest you spend some quality time alone with a copy of <em>Introverts in the Church.</em>" (Don Everts, minister of outreach, Bonhomme Presbyterian Church, Chesterfield, Missouri, and author of I Once Was Lost)<br><br>"As a fellow introvert, I well know the tension, irony and even contradiction of being in vocational ministry where public speaking and being with people are major and vital parts of our roles. This book puts together extremely helpful thinking to better understand who we are and how to navigate and celebrate being introverted and in leadership in an extroverted world."

I have done everything right this time around. I&#x2019;m a good boyfriend. I chose well. Amy Adam lives in the moment, not in the computer.<br> <br>&#x201c;Violets are the state flower of Rhode Island,&#x201d; I tell the guy wrapping up my flowers. His careless, dirty hands graze the petals, my petals. New Fucking York.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that so?&#x201d; He chuckles. &#x201c;You learn something new every day.&#x201d;<br> <br>I pay cash and carry my violets outside to East Seventh Street. It&#x2019;s hot for May and I smell the flowers. Rhode Island. I&#x2019;ve been to Rhode Island. I went to Little Compton last winter. I was lovesick, petrified that my girlfriend&#x2014;R.I.P. Guinevere Beck&#x2014;was in jeopardy because of her emotionally unstable friend&#x2014;R.I.P. Peach Salinger.<br> <br>Someone honks at me and I apologize. I know when something is my fault, and when you walk into a blinking crosswalk, it&#x2019;s your fault.<br> <br>Just like it was my fault last winter. I go over the mistake in my head a dozen times a day. How I was hiding in a closet upstairs at the Salinger house. How I had to pee but couldn&#x2019;t leave. So I pissed in a mug&#x2014;a ceramic mug&#x2014;and I put the mug down on the hardwood floor of the closet. I ran when I had the chance, and there is no way around it: I forgot the mug.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m a changed man because of that day. You can&#x2019;t go back and alter the past, but you can go forward, become a person who remembers. Now, I&#x2019;m committed to the details. For example, I recall with total precision the moment that Amy Kendall Adam returned to Mooney Rare and Used, to my life. I see her smile, her untamed hair (blond), and her r�sum� (lies). That was five months ago and she claimed she was looking for a job but you and I both know she was looking for me. I hired her, and she showed up on time for her first day with a spiral notebook and a list of rare books that she wanted to see. She had a glass container of superfruits and she told me they help you live forever. I told her that nobody gets to live forever and she laughed. She had a nice laugh, easy. She also had latex gloves.<br> <br>I picked one up. &#x201c;What are these?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So I don&#x2019;t hurt the books,&#x201d; she explained.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want you up front,&#x201d; I countered. &#x201c;This is just a basic job, mostly stocking shelves, manning the register.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But did you know that there are copies of Alice in Wonderland that are worth over a million dollars?&#x201d;<br> <br>I laughed. &#x201c;I hate to break your heart, but we don&#x2019;t have Alice downstairs.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Downstairs?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Is that where you keep the special books?&#x201d;<br> <br>I wanted to place my hand on the small of her back and lead her down to the cage, where the special books are preserved, boxed, saved. I wanted to strip her down and lock us inside and have her. But I was patient. I gave her a W-9 and a pen.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, I could help you go yard-sale-ing for old books,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You never know what you&#x2019;re going to find at yard sales.&#x201d;<br> <br>I smiled. &#x201c;Only if you promise not to call it yard-sale-ing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Amy smiled. The way she saw it, if she was going to work here, she was going to make a dent. She wanted us to travel uptown to estate sales and hunt library clearances and jam our hands into empty boxes on the street. She wanted to work together and this is how you get to know someone so well, so fast. You descend into musty vacated rooms together and you rush outside together to gulp the fresh air and laugh and agree that the only thing to do now is get a drink. We became a team.<br> <br>An old woman pushing a walker looks up at me. I smile. She points at the violets. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a good boy.&#x201d;<br> <br>I am. I thank her and keep walking.<br> <br>Amy and I started dating a few months ago while we were on the Upper East Side in a dead man&#x2019;s parlor. She tugged on the lapel of the navy blazer she had bought for me&#x2014;five bucks&#x2014;at a tag sale. She pleaded with me to drop seven hundred on a signed, wrinkled edition of The Easter Parade.<br> <br>&#x201c;Amy,&#x201d; I whispered. &#x201c;Yates isn&#x2019;t big right now and I don&#x2019;t see a resurgence on the horizon.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But I love him,&#x201d; she begged. &#x201c;This book means everything to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>This is women; they are emotional. You can&#x2019;t do business like this but you also can&#x2019;t look at Amy with her big blue eyes and her long blond hair out of a Guns N&#x2019; Roses song and say no to her.<br> <br>&#x201c;What can I do to change your mind?&#x201d; she wheedled.<br> <br>An hour later, I was the owner of an overpriced Easter Parade and Amy was sucking my dick in a Starbucks bathroom in Midtown and this was more romantic than it sounds because we liked each other. This was not a blowjob; this was fellatio, my friends. She stood and I pulled her boyfriend jeans to the floor and I stopped short. I knew she didn&#x2019;t like to shave; her legs were often bristly and she&#x2019;s all about water conservation. But I did not expect a bush. She kissed me. &#x201c;Welcome to the jungle.&#x201d;<br> <br>This is why I smile as I walk and this is how you get happy. Amy and I, we are sexier than Bob Dylan and Suze Rotolo on the cover of The Freewheelin&#x2019; and we are smarter than Tom Cruise and Pen�lope Cruz in Vanilla Sky. We have a project: We are amassing copies of Portnoy&#x2019;s Complaint. It&#x2019;s one of our favorite books and we reread it together. She underlined her favorite parts with a Sharpie and I told her to use a more delicate pen.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not delicate,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I hate delicate.&#x201d;<br> <br>Amy is a Sharpie; she&#x2019;s passionate. She fucking loves Portnoy&#x2019;s Complaint and I want to possess all the dark yellow copies ever made and keep them in the basement so that only Amy and I can touch them. I&#x2019;m not supposed to overstock a title, but I like fucking Amy near our yellow wall of books. Philip Roth would approve. She laughed when I told her that and said we should write him a letter. She has an imagination, a heart.<br> <br>My phone rings. It&#x2019;s Gleason Brothers Electricians about the humidifier but it can wait. I have an e-mail from BuzzFeed about some list of cool indie bookstores and that can wait too. Everything can wait when you have love in your life. When you can just walk down the street and picture the girl you love naked on a mound of yellow Complaints.<br> <br>I reach Mooney Books and the bell chimes as I open the door. Amy crosses her arms and glares at me and maybe she&#x2019;s allergic to flowers. Maybe violets suck.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; I ask, and I hope this isn&#x2019;t it, the beginning of the end, when the girl becomes a cunt, when the new car smell evaporates.<br> <br>&#x201c;Flowers?&#x201d; she asks. &#x201c;You know what I want more than flowers?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shake my head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Keys,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;A guy was just here and I could have sold him the Yates but I couldn&#x2019;t show it because I don&#x2019;t have keys.&#x201d;<br> <br>I toss the flowers on the counter. &#x201c;Slow down. Did you get a number?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Joe,&#x201d; she says, tapping her foot. &#x201c;I love this business. And I know I&#x2019;m being a dumb girl and I shouldn&#x2019;t tell you how into this I am. But please. I want keys.&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t say anything. I need to memorize it all, lock it away for safekeeping, the low hum of the music&#x2014;the Rolling Stones&#x2019; &#x201c;Sweet Virginia,&#x201d; one of my favorites&#x2014;and the way the light is right now. I don&#x2019;t lock the door. I don&#x2019;t flip the OPEN sign over. I walk to the other side of the counter and I take her in my arms and I dip her and I kiss her and she kisses me back.<br> <br>I&#x2019;VE never given anyone a key. But this is what&#x2019;s supposed to happen. Your life is supposed to expand. Your bed is supposed to have enough room for someone else and when that someone comes along, it&#x2019;s your job to let her in. I seize my future. I pay extra to get ridiculous theme keys, pink and flowery. And when I place these pink metallic things in the palm of Amy&#x2019;s hand, she kisses them.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know this is huge,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Thank you, Joe.

Glowingly reviewed, <i>What I Saw</i> introduces a new generation to the genius of this tortured author with its "nonstop brilliance, irresistible charm and continuing relevance" (Jeffrey Eugenides, <i>The New York Times</i> Book Review). As if anticipating Christopher Isherwood, the book re-creates the tragicomic world of 1920s Berlin as seen by its greatest journalistic eyewitness. In 1920, Joseph Roth, the most renowned German correspondent of his age, arrived in Berlin, the capital of the Weimar Republic. He produced a series of impressionistic and political essays that influenced an entire generation of writers, including Thomas Mann and the young Christopher Isherwood. Translated and collected here for the first time, these pieces record the violent social and political paroxysms that constantly threatened to undo the fragile democracy that was the Weimar Republic. Roth, like no other German writer of his time, ventured beyond Berlin's official veneer to the heart of the city, chronicling the lives of its forgotten inhabitants: the war cripples, the Jewish immigrants from the Pale, the criminals, the bathhouse denizens, and the nameless dead who filled the morgues. Warning early on of the dangers posed by the Nazis, Roth evoked a landscape of moral bankruptcy and debauched beauty; a memorable portrait of a city and a time of commingled hope and chaos. <i>What I Saw</i>, like no other existing work, records the violent social and political paroxysms that compromised and ultimately destroyed the precarious democracy that was the Weimar Republic.</p><p><p><strong>Joseph Roth</strong> (1894-1939) was the great elegist of the cosmopolitan culture that flourished in the dying days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He published several books and articles before his untimely death at the age of 44. Roth&#x2019;s writing has been admired by J. M. Coetzee, Jeffrey Eugenides, Elie Wiesel, and Nadine Gordimer, among many others.</p><p>The poet Michael Hofmann has won numerous prizes for his German translations.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>PERRINE&#39;S LITERATURE:STRUCTURE...AP ED.</h2><p>Perrine's Literature: Structure, Sound &amp; Sense - AP Edition</p><p></p><h2>Civilization and Its Discontents (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>In what remains one of his most seminal papers, Freud considers the incompatibility of civilisation and individual happiness, and the tensions between the claims of society and the individual.

Two years, 75 games, 2,642 correct answers, and over $2.5 million in winnings later, Ken Jennings emerged as trivia&#x2019;s undisputed king. <i>Brainiac</i> traces his rise from anonymous computer programmer to nerd folk icon. But along the way, it also explores his newly conquered kingdom: the world of trivia itself.<br><br>Jennings had always been minutiae-mad, poring over almanacs and TV Guide listings at an age when most kids are still watching Elmo and putting beans up their nose. But trivia, he has found, is centuries older than his childhood obsession with it. Whisking us from the coffeehouses of seventeenth-century London to the Internet age, Jennings chronicles the ups and downs of the trivia fad: the quiz book explosion of the Jazz Age; the rise, fall, and rise again of TV quiz shows; the nostalgic campus trivia of the 1960s; and the 1980s, when Trivial Pursuit� again made it fashionable to be a know-it-all.<br>Jennings also investigates the shadowy demimonde of today&#x2019;s trivia subculture, guiding us on a tour of trivia hotspots across America. He goes head-to-head with the blowhards and diehards of the college quiz-bowl circuit, the slightly soused faithful of the Boston pub trivia scene, and the raucous participants in the annual Q&amp;A marathon in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, &#x201c;The World&#x2019;s Largest Trivia Contest.&#x201d; And, of course, he takes us behind the scenes of his improbable 75-game run on Jeopardy!<br><br>But above all, <i>Brainiac </i>is a love letter to the useless fact.

The red rock country of southern Utah is red for the same reason that the planet Mars has a pinkish tinge when you see it in the night sky: both are loaded with iron oxide, a.k.a. ordinary household rust. The shadows of these red desert crags are lengthening toward our car as it pulls into a dusty gas station on the Utah-Arizona border. The air smells of diesel fumes and sagebrush when I open the passenger-side door. My friend Earl Cahill unfolds himself from the driver's seat, relieved we've made it to this, our last chance at gas for fifty miles. <br>Earl is my old college roommate, and though he's a remarkable six-foot-nine in height, he's one of those giants who hope that by holding their head and shoulders at just the right dejected angle, they may somehow&#x2014;if not disappear completely&#x2014;at least give the appearance of being only six-foot-four or six-foot-five. He blinks into the setting sun through the shock of floppy brown hair hanging over his face, a face that bears the perpetually disappointed look of an English foxhound or a Cubs fan. <br>As I pump gas, we re-enact the ritual of all road-trippers since the days of Jack Kerouac, and try to figure out how we're going to divvy up the trip's costs. Unlike our beatnik freeway forefathers, however, Earl and I are both computer programmers, and we're driving down to Los Angeles not to hear jazz or harvest lettuce or watch the sun set over the Pacific, but to try to land spots on <i>Jeopardy!</i>, America's most popular and most difficult quiz show. Appropriately, geekily, we are squabbling about the most <i>elegant algorithm</i> to calculate and divide up our expenses. <br>"How about this?" I offer. "There's two of us, so that vastly improves our chances that one of us will make it on the show, right? And, as we know, that person is guaranteed at least a thousand dollars, even if he finishes in third place. So here's what we do: we split all expenses when we get back, but if one of us makes it on the show, that person pays for the other's share of gas and other expenses from this trip." <br>Earl's brow furrows, suspicious he's being conned. <br>"It's no-lose," I persist. "If you get on the show, you pay for all expenses, but you still turn a big profit from your winnings. The one who doesn't get on loses nothing." <br>"Deal," he finally agrees. We shake on it as we switch spots and climb back into the car. It <i>is</i> a no-lose scenario, but I'm guessing that I'll end up being the beneficiary of my own plan. Earl, I figure, is exactly the type game shows look for. Besides being incredibly smart and, as he likes to put it, "sideshow-freak tall," he has a booming baritone voice and an eccentric way of speaking&#x2014;an inside-joke-rich patois of computer-hacker lingo, <i>Simpsons</i> references and, mysteriously, quotes from Merchant Ivory movies. He's exactly the kind of larger-than-life personality <i>Jeopardy!</i> needs&#x2014;a lock to get on the show. I figure I've just negotiated myself a free trip to L.A. <br>But, I admit to myself, I'm not just along for the ride as Earl's road-trip buddy. For as long as I can remember, I've dreamed of being on <i>Jeopardy!</i>, and Earl knows it. "You know," he says, "I keep telling myself that even if I fail the test, at least I can tell people I was the guy that got Ken Jennings on <i>Jeopardy!</i>" We pull back onto I-15 and drive off into the sunset. <br>* * * *<br>I've been meaning to try out for <i>Jeopardy!</i> for twenty years now, but I've loved trivia for even longer. My generation tends to think of trivia as an eighties craze, something we cherish nostalgically in the same neurons of our brain responsible for remembering Members Only jackets and Ralph Macchio. The watershed trivia year of my youth was clearly 1984, the year that the Alex Trebek version of <i>Jeopardy!</i> debuted on the airwaves and Trivial Pursuit sold twenty million copies, supplanting Pac-Man as <i>the</i> game craze of the era. But ask someone ten years younger what year trivia peaked, and her "final answer" would probably be 1999 or so, when <i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</i> became so explosively popular. Someone of my parents' generation might associate the word "trivia" with the vogue for college campus trivia contests in the late 1960s, while my grandparents would certainly remember America holding its breath as contestants sweated it out in isolation booths on the high-rated (and highly rigged) TV quiz shows of the 1950s. A scholar in the field might even point you back to 1927, when the best-selling book <i>Ask Me Another!</i> ignited the very first question-and-answer craze in America. If trivia is a fad, in other words, it's certainly a pesky one. Like the Terminator, Halley's Comet, or genital herpes, trivia just keeps coming back. <br>And it's still around. In fact, though trivia isn't necessarily faddish at the moment, it's still somehow omnipresent. America plays hundreds of thousands of trivia games every day&#x2014;in urban bars, on suburban coffee tables, on FM radio stations, on cell phones. Trivia appears on our beer coasters, under our Snapple caps, on our Cracker Jack prizes. It clogs our e-mail inboxes and magazine article sidebars. It fills the blank space at the bottom of columns in the phone book. It pacifies us while we watch the cola-sponsored advertising on movie screens. It's the bumper that takes us to commercial on cable news and entertainment shows. It's such a familiar part of American life that we don't even notice it anymore, and yet there it always is. We live surrounded by trivia. <br>"Trivia," the word itself, pre-dates 1984 and Trivial Pursuit, of course. In fact, it goes back millennia. Originally a Roman name for the goddess Hecate, in her role as guardian of the crossroads, "Trivia" derives from the Latin "trivium": a crossroads where "three ways" met. Centuries later, English writer John Gay named his most famous poem, a 1716 description of a walking tour of London, "Trivia," in honor of the same goddess. (Gay is better known for his satirical <i>The Beggar's Opera</i>, the musical work upon which Brecht's <i>Threepenny Opera</i> was based, which means he's also responsible for the pop song that was the #1 <i>Billboard</i> hit of 1959.)1 <br>The Latin word "trivium" is also our source for the adjective form "trivial," meaning unimportant or ordinary. It's generally believed that "trivial" came to mean commonplace because a "trivium" or public crossroads was, literally, a "common place." Others claim that the adjective "trivial" derives from another use of "trivium"&#x2014;in medieval universities, the course load was divided between the three-subject trivium and the four-subject quadrivium. The trio of courses in the trivium was always grammar, rhetoric, and logic, while the quadrivium was composed of home ec, driver's ed, wood shop, and band (oh, all right: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music.) The trivium contained the easier, more elementary subjects, thought to be less important than the advanced quadrivium, and, hence, "trivial." <br>In the 20th century, the noun form "trivia" first began to be used as a derivative of "trivial" to refer to trifles, or things deemed unimportant. As early as 1902, popular essayist Logan Pearsall Smith (the brother-in-law, incidentally, of philosopher Bertrand Russell) published a bestselling collection of brief philosophical musings under the title <i>Trivia</i>. But the word didn't adopt its current usage&#x2014;"questions and answers about unusual bits of everyday knowledge"&#x2014;until the mid-1960s. <br>I've always felt it was a shame that the "trivia" moniker stuck to trivia so firmly. Referring to your hobby with a word that quite literally means "petty" or "insignificant" doesn't strike me as the best way to popularize it. Would football ever have caught on if gridiron fans insisted on calling it "that stupid sport with the weird-shaped ball"? Do philatelists call postage stamps "little gummed squares that we pointlessly collect and pore over when we really should be out meeting girls"? And yet trivia fans happily adopt the language of the oppressor, tacitly but cheerfully agreeing that, yes, their tendency toward learning and knowing lots of weird stuff is completely valueless. Completely "trivial." <br>I first heard the words "trivial" and "nontrivial" in their scientific usage in the math and computer science classes I took in college. To math and computer nerds, a trivial problem is one with a ridiculously easy solution, one the teacher probably won't even bother to put up on the overhead projector. Science is, instead, about the pursuit of the unusual, elegant solution&#x2014;the nontrivial one. For example, I remember learning once about "sum-product numbers," numbers equal to the sum of all their digits multiplied by the product of all their digits. There are an infinite number of numbers, said the instructor, but only three sum-product numbers. The number 1 is the trivial solution, the boring one: 1 � 1 = 1. The interesting solutions are the nontrivial ones&#x2014;135, for instance (though there's one other):2 <br>((1 + 3 + 5) � (1 � 3 � 5)) = 135 <br>Ever since I can remember, I've had the idea that trivia, despite its name, <i>is</i> elegant, complicated, fascinating, worthy of study&#x2014;that trivia is, in a word, nontrivial. <br><br>Answers<br>1 Bobby Darin's "Mack the Knife"<br>2 144 is as well</p><h2>Sharpe's Escape: Richard Sharpe &amp; the Bussaco Campaign, 1810 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #10)</h2><p><p><strong>From <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Bernard Cornwell, the tenth installment in the world-renowned<em>&nbsp;</em>Sharpe series, chronicling the rise of Richard Sharpe, a Private in His Majesty&#x2019;s Army at the siege of Seringapatam. </strong></p><p>Sharpe&#x2019;s job as Captain of the Light Company is under threat and he has made a new enemy, a Portuguese criminal known as Ferragus. Discarded by his regiment, Sharpe wages a private war against Ferragus &#x2013; a war fought through the burning, pillaged streets of Coimbra, Portugal&#x2019;s ancient university city.</p><p>Sharpe&#x2019;s Escape begins on the great, gaunt ridge of Bussaco where a joint British and Portuguese army meets the overwhelming strength of Marshall Massena&#x2019;s crack troops. It finishes at Torres Vedras where the French hopes of occupying Portugal quickly die.</p></p><p><p>It is 1810, and in Napoleon's determination to conquer Portugal -- and push the British back to the sea -- he sends his largest army yet across the Spanish frontier. But between the Portuguese border and Napoleon's seemingly certain victory are twoobstacles -- a wasted land, stripped of food by Wellington's orders, and Captain Richard Sharpe.</p><p>But Sharpe is in trouble. The captain of the Light Company is threatened from inside and out: First by an incompetent British officer, who by virtue of family connections is temporarily given Sharpe's command. An even greater danger is posed by two corrupt Portuguese brothers -- Major Ferreira, a high-ranking officer in the army of Portugal, and his brother, nicknamed "Ferragus" (after a legen-dary Portuguese giant), who makes no claims to respectability, preferring instead to rule by crude physical strength and pure intimidation. Together the brothers have developed a devious plot to ingratiate themselves with the French invaders who are threatening to become Portugal's new rulers.</p><p>Sharpe's interference in the first stage of their plan earns the undying enmity of the brothers. Ferragus vows revenge and plots a merciless trap that seems certain to kill Sharpe and his intimates -- battle-tested ally Sergeant Harper, the Portuguese officer Jorge Vicente, and a prickly but lovely English governess. As the city of Coimbra is burned and pillaged, Sharpe and his companions plot a daring escape, ensuring that Ferragus will follow on toward Lisbon, into the jaws of a snare laid by Wellington -- the massive lines of Torres Vedras, a daring and ingenious last stand against the invaders. There, beneath the British guns, Sharpe is reunited with his shattered but grateful company, and meets his enemies in a thrilling and decisive fight.</p><p>Sharpe's Escape emphatically reaffirms Bernard Cornwell's status as "perhaps the greatest writer of historical adventure novels today" (<em>Washington Post</em>); its climactic battle scenes and evocative re-creation of history sweep the reader off the page and into the action and drama of nineteenth-century warfare.</p><p>BERNARD CORNWELL is the author of the acclaimed <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Saxon Tales series, which includes <em>The Last Kingdom, The Pale Horseman, Lords of the North, Sword Song, The Burning Land, Death of Kings, The Pagan Lord</em>, and, most recently, <em>The Empty Throne </em>and <em>Warriors of the Storm</em>, and which serves as the basis for the hit television series <em>The Last Kingdom</em>.

Every week yet another incident involving racial tension splashes across headlines and dominates our news feeds. But it's not easy to unpack the origins of these tensions, and perhaps we wonder whether any of these issues really has anything to do with us. Ken Wytsma, founder of the Justice Conference, understands these questions. He has gone through his own journey of understanding the underpinnings of inequality and privilege. In this timely, insightful book Wytsma unpacks what we need to know to be grounded in conversations about today's race-related issues. And he helps us come to a deeper understanding of both the origins of these issues and the reconciling role we are called to play as witnesses of the gospel. Inequality and privilege are real. <em>The Myth of Equality</em> opens our eyes to realities we may have never realized were present in our society and world. And we will be changed for the better as a result.</p><p>Ken Wytsma is a leader, communicator, and social entrepreneur. He is the author of <i>Pursuing Justice, <i>The Grand Paradox,&nbsp;and <em>Create vs. Copy</em>. <em>Publishers Weekly</em> has&nbsp;called him&nbsp;"one of the new breed of evangelical Christians returning to scripture to redeem justice as a central tenet of faith." Ken is the founder of The Justice Conference, an annual international conference that introduces people to a wide range of organizations and conversations related to biblical justice, which has reached over twenty thousand people at conferences across five continents. In addition to serving as the founding pastor of Antioch Church in Bend, Oregon, Ken is president of Kilns College, where he teaches courses on philosophy, justice, and creative leadership. Ken also served for several years as the executive director of a creative office for World Relief and has written articles appearing in <em>RELEVANT Magazine</em>, <em>Church Leaders</em>, <em>Huffington Post</em>, <em>Worship Leader Magazine</em>, <em>OUTREACH Magazine</em></i><em>, and more. Ken lives in Portland, Oregon, with his wife, Tamara, and their four daughters.</em></i>Publishers Weekly (Starred Review)<br>Wytsma (Pursuing Justice), lead pastor of Antioch Church in Bend, Ore., and president of Kilns College, has a gift for persuasive argument, well displayed in his deployment of history, biblical theology, and current affairs to demonstrate the subtle and unsubtle ways that white dominance shapes American culture and conversations about race. He does so from the perspective of a passionately committed evangelical Christian calling prophetically for justice for those who have been consistently disadvantaged by a system and culture built on what &#x201c;a white normative standard&#x201d; that shapes perceptions and judgments. Wytsma makes his points without accusation, the better to address an audience of white readers who may be unaccustomed to looking beneath the surface of attitudes about race or unaware of the history of Jim Crow laws and other forces that drove racial segregation. He is especially good at giving a quick tour of the post-Reconstruction history of race. Slavery was formally ended, but disenfranchisement, &#x201c;Black Codes&#x201d; in the South, redlining in housing, and other forms of social control perpetuated inequality. This book should be a wake-up call to Christian communities nationwide.<br><br>"<i>The Myth of Equality</i> is written so skillfully that it's easy to miss how much it accomplishes. The first part brings to light, with unflinching honesty, how deeply racism and white privilege are embedded within the founding documents and practices of the United States. The second part masterfully shows that this inequality violates the call of the gospel to justice and unity. And the third part offers some wise suggestions to those of us who are white Christians about how we can 'lay down' our white privilege. I have no doubt that some readers will be angered by the claim that they participate in and benefit from structures of racism and white privilege, well supported though that claim is. I predict that there will be more who are convinced and inspired by the patient, passionate, and nondefensive way in which Wytsma makes his case. It's a book that someone had to write." (Nicholas Wolterstorff, Noah Porter Professor Emeritus of Philosophical Theology, Yale University, senior research fellow, Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture, University of Virginia, honorary professor, Australian Catholic University)<br><br>"White progressives, evangelical and not, seem to enjoy feeling bad about racial injustice and wagging self-righteous fingers at others, but they often exacerbate the injustices of racism by hardening the lines of defense. Far too often the only solutions proposed are more laws, tightening existing laws, and social engineering through public education. What we need are not resolutions but solutions&#x2015;solutions emerging from real people in real settings, with leaders who have discovered the long, painful path that leads from white privilege and white invisibility to social integration, racial reconciliation, and churches abounding in fellowship across racial lines and celebrating the glories of ethnicities. Ken Wytsma is the kind of leader who offers real solutions toward social&nbsp;integration and racial reconciliation, and he comes from that kind of community and church. <em>The Myth of Equality</em> is a genuine contribution for those of us looking for ways forward." (Scot McKnight, Julius R. Mantey Professor of New Testament, Northern Seminary)<br><br>"White privilege is a subject that few dare to tackle. I applaud Ken for venturing into this rough terrain. Ken's historical approach to white privilege drives the conversation deeper and challenges readers to move beyond a political perspective, toward a kingdom view. His personal journey keeps it grounded in reality. A much needed book for our times." (Leroy Barber, The Voices Project)<br><br>"With great sensitivity, wisdom, and boldness, Ken takes on the tough, often-taboo topics of privilege and race. He makes a cogent, powerful, and compelling argument for why addressing race and understanding privilege allows us to more fully live out the gospel. He boils down complicated concepts to relatable points through his interweaving of scholars' writings, activists' thinking, historical realities, and personal stories. His humility and posture of learning from others, particularly people of color, make this book an authentic, effective tool for followers of Christ taking seriously the call to pursue justice. This book is needed, timely, and will help reshape the conversation around race in America." (Jenny Yang, vice president of advocacy and policy, World Relief)<br><br>"Ken Wytsma goes where few dare to tread. He asks hard questions about race, justice, and equality and presents proven and practical solutions. Above all, Ken personifies these solutions; he is seeking to live justice, not just do it. The message in <em>The Myth of Equality</em> is urgent; it's a must-read." (Stephan Bauman, former president and CEO of World Relief, author of Break Open the Sky)<br><br>"These are challenging times in our larger culture&#x2015;and within the church. In the midst of these tensions, I'm grateful for voices like Ken Wytsma who are seeking to help the church not only to engage the various challenges but to do it from a posture of humility and deep self-reflection. In <em>The Myth of Equality</em>, Wytsma broaches an incredibly sensitive but pertinent conversation about equality, privilege, race, injustice, and reconciliation. But herein lies the challenge: many of us love the idea of reconciliation&#x2015;until we learn that it inevitably involves the messy and arduous work of listening to others' stories, truth telling, confessing, repenting, dismantling, healing, and peacemaking. <em>The Myth of Equality</em> is an important and timely book that helps us dig deeper on the journey of justice and reconciliation." (Eugene Cho, pastor and humanitarian, author of Overrated)<br><br>"<em>The Myth of Equality</em> is a book for our times. Tumultuous times do not create problems, they reveal them. Political disruption, racial division, and extreme polarization mandate that the church looks itself in the mirror. We must recognize that to whom much is given, much is expected. Privilege is not just a modern progressive agenda, it is an ancient, biblically recognized reality. Ken Wytsma has done the church a favor that can help us recapture the blessed virtue of giving. Leaders seriously interested in helping Christians navigate these important issues would be well served to engage this book." (Tyler Johnson, lead pastor, Redemption Arizona)<br><br>"One of the greatest obstacles to the journey toward racial justice and reconciliation within the US church is the refusal of white Christians to confront the realities of white supremacy and white privilege. Here, Ken Wytsma comes alongside white Christians to help them tackle this issue, not from the perspective of a distant expert, but as one who continues to wrestle with how privilege and racism impact his own discipleship journey. Rooted in Scripture, history, and personal experience, <em>The Myth of Equality</em> is a valuable primer for anyone struggling to understand racism and privilege." (Chanequa Walker-Barnes, associate professor of practical theology, McAfee School of Theology, Mercer University, author of Too Heavy a Yoke)<br><br>"The American church stands at an important crossroads. Will we embrace God's plan for the church as revealed in Revelation 7:9, or will the church disintegrate into the chaos, confusion, and cacophony akin to the story of the Tower of Babel as we build dividing walls of hostility? In order to move into God's heart for the church, truth-telling must occur. Without truth, we simply rebuild the Tower of Babel rather than become the people of God. In this book, Ken Wytsma embraces the courage needed to speak the truth in love. Wytsma speaks the truth even at the risk of putting himself in peril. That kind of truth-telling is much needed in our turbulent world. Thank you, Ken, for the courage expressed in this book. May you who engage this book also find the similar courage to take these truths and be transformed by them." (Soong-Chan Rah, Milton B. Engebretson Professor of Church Growth and Evangelism, North Park Theological Seminary, author of The Next Evangelicalism and Prophetic Lament)<br><br>"Stretching back to the earliest arrivals of Europeans on our coasts, the United States has been built on a long history of racial and ethnic injustice, and white Christians have been strikingly reticent about this history. Ken Wytsma's <em>The Myth of Equality</em> gently and gracefully initiates a conversation with white Christians about the racial brokenness of our land. This is a timely book that speaks bluntly about our past and in so doing orients us for the long, slow journey toward healing these wounds." (C.

But, pulling a boy out of a gulper's tummy isn't all that simple.

He lives in Edinburgh with his wife and two young sons.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>PreS-Gr 1-Louis and his sister find themselves deep inside the stomach of a Saber-toothed Yumper when a leisurely bike ride through the woods turns into a monstrous chase into prehistoric lands. After Louis is swallowed by a Gulper, Sarah sets off to rescue him, but each creature that consumes him is set upon by a larger one, and the chase is on. Finally, she must crawl into the stomach of the Saber-toothed Yumper and, flashlight in hand, wind her way through the insides of all the other beasts to retrieve her brother. Although the situation resolves itself when the creature feels a real "frog in its throat," the siblings are not free to return home until one of them finds a more vocal way to scare away the still-hungry Guzzler, Grabular, Undersnatch, and Gulper. Fardell cleverly morphs verbs into the names of the monsters chasing Louis and a two-wheeled bicycle into a machine capable of floating, rock climbing, and flight. The antics are over-the-top, and the creatures are more funny than scary, making this picture book a natural for storytime fun.-Tanya Boudreau, Cold Lake Public Library, AB, Canada&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

No man had looked at her like that since she'd first crossed paths with her ex-husband back in college. And even before the divorce, it had been a couple of years since Walter had regarded her with that degree of interest. It was unnerving.<br><br>Of course, a lot about her life these days was unnerving. With a whole lot of support from her two best friends, Annie Sullivan Townsend and Raylene Hammond, Sarah had finally gotten up the gumption to divorce Walter and&#x2014;equally important&#x2014;his entire controlling, uptight family. She'd fought to win custody of her two kids, Tommy and Libby.<br><br>And, mostly in the interest of getting out of the house and doing <em>something, </em>she'd taken a part-time job waiting on tables at Wharton's, where just about everyone in Serenity congregated at one time or another during the week. It might not be making use of her degree in elementary education, but it was surprisingly satisfying. She'd discovered she had a knack for getting people to open up, a necessity in a restaurant that prided itself on being the hotbed of local gossip.<br><br>No one, however, seemed to have any idea of who the mysterious man in that back booth might be. Sarah had asked.<br><br>Just now, she'd even asked the man himself point-blank if he was new in town, here to stay or just passing through. He responded with a slow, sexy, dimpled grin that had unexpectedly sent her recently comatose libido into overdrive.<br><br>"I suppose I could be persuaded to stay if the right offer came along," he said in a low voice that hummed across her senses. "You offerin', sugar?"<br><br>Sarah was so taken aback by the flirtatious question, she scurried straight off to the kitchen to place his order. It was one thing to chat up old man Watson from the feed and grain, or the town mayor, whom she'd known since she was in diapers. It was quite another to have a man with dreamy eyes and a voice that could lure a woman straight to bed act almost as if he wanted to take her...well, straight to bed.<br><br>Which, of course, he didn't. She knew that. Hadn't she heard often enough about all her flaws&#x2014;her weight, her disorganization, her lack of mothering skills&#x2014;from her ex-husband? In retaliation for her decision to file for divorce before he had a chance to, Walter had made it his personal mission in life to see that she had not one shred of self-esteem left by the time they ended their marriage. Worse, even knowing that he was just being his ornery old self, she'd been so low that she'd taken every mean-spirited word to heart.<br><br>In the past few months, she'd worked hard to get herself back into shape. Annie had been her personal trainer at The Corner Spa, and Sarah had finally knocked off most of the weight she'd gained during two pregnancies. She had another ten pounds she'd like to sweat off, but if it didn't happen, well, she could live with that, too. Despite her success, though, she sometimes still saw herself through Walter's eyes, which annoyed the daylights out of her friends. It irked her, too, but the stream of a few years of nonstop criticism was embedded so deep, it was almost impossible to shake.<br><br>"Grace, you need to take that burger and fries to table nine," she told the owner of the old-fashioned soda fountain. The down-home cooking continued to bring in business even now that the pharmacy side of the operation was taking a hit from some of the bigger discount pharmacies in the region. In Sarah's opinion it was friendly service and gossip that had kept it afloat.<br><br>Grace Wharton eyed her curiously. "Why would you suddenly want to turn a man who looks like that and tips like a city slicker over to me?"<br><br>"Just do it, please," Sarah pleaded, not wanting to admit he made her nervous.<br><br>Grace's eyes narrowed. "Did he say something to offend you? If he did, I'll throw him out of here on his backside, attractive though that backside might be."<br><br>Sarah turned pink with embarrassment. "No, he was just joking around, that's all. You know, flirting the way some guys do. I should be used to it."<br><br>Grace observed her thoughtfully. "Seems to me you could use a sweet-talkin' stranger to put a little color back into your cheeks."<br><br>"I most definitely do not need a man," Sarah declared emphatically. "I just got rid of the one I had."<br><br>"Good riddance is what I say," Grace declared. "The way I hear it, all he ever did was tear you down. Now you need a fella to perk you back up. I'd think a little sweet talk would be music to your ears."<br><br>It was an oft-repeated refrain. In the month she'd been working at Wharton's, Grace had not only offered that opinion on an almost daily basis, she'd suited action to words and trotted out half the single men in town for Sarah's inspection. For all Sarah knew, this man could be the latest.<br><br>"Do you know him?" she inquired suspiciously. "The man in booth nine? Did you drive over to Columbia or Sumter or someplace and recruit him to sit in here and stroke my ego?"<br><br>Grace looked genuinely appalled by the suggestion. "Absolutely not! As if I would do such a thing. I never saw him before he turned up in here a couple of days ago," she said with obvious frustration. "He's not registered over at the Serenity Inn, either. I checked."<br><br>"Could be he's staying with friends or family," Sarah speculated.<br><br>"Might be, but it's no one who comes in here regularlike," Grace insisted. "Besides, if he were someone's guest, wouldn't they be sittin' right there with him? He's obviously on his own."<br><br>"What about Mary Vaughn?" Sarah asked. "Not only does she usually lock on to any new single man in the entire region, but she'd know if he looked at real estate."<br><br>"Sadly, since she got back together with Sonny, they take their lunch hours together...at home, if you know what I mean," Grace said with a grin. "Those two act like they're honeymooning all over again. Can't say I see much of either one of them. When she does come in for coffee, she's always in a rush. She gets out of here before I can get a word out of her."<br><br>"Well, someone must know who he is," Sarah said with frustration. "I asked him directly if he was new in town, and he didn't give me a straight answer." Her cheeks burned at the memory of his teasing.<br><br>Grace regarded her with amusement. "For someone who claims not to be interested in the man, you sure are determined to figure this out," she said as she picked up the plate with the burger and fries, then added another couple of meals to a tray. "You sure you don't want to take this out there yourself?"<br><br>Sarah shook her head. "You do it. I'll take more coffee to the mayor and his buddies, maybe see if I can tempt them into putting a little ice cream on that peach pie you baked this morning."<br><br>"I declare those men are going to gain ten pounds by the end of the month, the way you talk them into having dessert every day." She shook a finger under Sarah's nose. "I don't want their wives in here grumbling at me, you hear. And George Ulster has diabetes, so don't be trying to talk him into pie and such."<br><br>Sarah grinned. "George always gets sugar-free ice cream. Howard Lewis is a widower, so nobody's going to come in here complaining about his weight, and Fred Watson's skinny as a scarecrow. It's all good, Grace."<br><br>Grace gave her a sorrowful look. "Why you'd want to hang around those old geezers when there's a certifiable hunk in here is beyond me, but there's no accounting for taste," she said, nudging the door with her ample hip and heading out of the kitchen with the three meals balanced on a tray as if it weighed next to nothing. With her round face, pink cheeks, greying hair, granny glasses perched on the end of her nose and the red uniform she'd unwisely chosen to match the decor, she looked a bit like Mrs. Claus.<br><br>Sarah picked up pots of decaf and regular coffee and followed in her wake, careful not to glance toward booth nine. Something told her that a pair of sea-green eyes would be watching her, and that they'd fill with knowing amusement when Grace arrived with his lunch.<br><br>Fortunately, Wharton's was too busy for her to spend much time worrying about what he thought. She didn't even glance in his direction.<br><br>But when he rose and started toward the door, she knew it with every fiber of her being. And when he stopped just behind her and drawled, "See you tomorrow, sugar," she juggled the tray she was carrying and nearly upended two tuna-melt specials onto the black-and-white tiled floor. Bright color once again flooded her cheeks.<br><br>Before she could flee to the kitchen, he was gone, leaving her flustered and irritated in just about equal proportions.<br><br>"I don't know why he rattles me so badly," Sarah said that evening as she, Raylene and Annie sipped margaritas on the back patio at her small bungalow. She'd settled there with Tommy and Libby when it had become obvious that her marriage was all but over. It was the perfect May evening in South Carolina, warm but without the oppressive humidity that would soon set in.<br><br>She'd fled to Serenity from Alabama for a break, originally intending to go back all fixed up to suit Walter's idea of the perfect wife. It hadn't taken long to realize that she'd be wasting her time trying to meet his high standards. Thank heaven her parents had had the foresight to keep this house even after they'd moved to a new retirement home on the gulf coast of Texas, apparently guessing long before she did that her marriage was doomed.<br><br>"Have either of you seen him or heard anything about him?" she asked her friends.<br><br>"Well, you know I haven't," Raylene said wryly.<br><br>Ever since she'd moved back to Serenity to escape her abusive husband in Charleston, Raylene had rarely left the house. Sarah had given her a safe haven, and in return Raylene looked after the house and babysat Tommy and Libby on occasion when the regular sitter had time off. It had been the perfect solution for both of them, though Sarah was starting to wonder just how healthy it was for Raylene to continue hiding out and pretending her problems didn't exist.<br><br>"About that," Annie began, only to draw a quelling look from Raylene that stopped whatever she'd been about to say.<br><br>Trying to broker peace, to say nothing of getting back to her own concern, Sarah said, "Focus, ladies. Who is this man? What's he doing in Serenity?"<br><br>Annie gave her an amused look. "I'm with Grace. You're showing a lot of curiosity for someone who's supposedly not interested."<br><br>Sarah scowled at her. "Well, what if he's a stalker or, even more likely, what if he's spying for Walter? I wouldn't put it past my ex to send some guy over here to try to get me all tied up in knots so I'll do something stupid that'll make it easy for him to snatch Tommy away from me."<br><br>It still stuck in everyone's craw, especially hers, that Walter had expressed interest in gaining custody only of his son&#x2014;the heir to the Price family legacy, an Alabama cotton mill&#x2014;but not his daughter. In fact, her lawyer, Helen Decatur, had used that very fact to show the judge why he was an insensitive, unfit parent.<br><br>Raylene looked thoughtful. "It would be just like that jerk," she said, despite the fact that she'd never personally laid eyes on the offensive Walter. She hid out in her room on the days he came to see the kids, claiming she didn't want to intrude or to say something to make the situation between him and Sarah any worse.<br><br>"Agreed," Annie said. Since she had first-hand knowledge of some of Walter's shenanigans after Sarah's return to Serenity, she spoke with even more authority. "I'll have Helen check him out. Or maybe my dad. With his store right there on Main Street, he sees pretty much everything that's going on in town. And I'll ask Jeanette to talk to Tom. She's been off for a couple of days, but she'll be in tomorrow. As town manager, Tom can check with the sheriff and see if they've been keeping an eye on anyone suspicious."<br><br>"Great idea," Raylene said, shuddering a bit. She was still spooked by the idea of strangers in town, even though she knew perfectly well that her ex was in jail.<br><br>Sarah flinched at the all-out investigation she seemed to have sparked. Maybe she'd overreacted just a little.<br><br>"Are you sure we're not going overboard? Could be he's just new in town and a big flirt."<br><br>"Then we need to know that," Annie said. "It'll put your mind at ease."<br><br>"Or it'll rattle you even more," Raylene said with a grin, which was a rare enough sight to be worth noting.<br><br>"I am not interested in this man," Sarah declared forcefully.<br><br>Her friends, darn 'em both, simply laughed.<br><br>Travis McDonald sat in his cousin's kitchen nursing a cup of coffee and thinking about the pretty little waitress at Wharton's who'd been providing him with so much entertainment for the past few days. Yesterday he'd scared her so bad, she'd sent Grace over with his meal. Today she'd avoided him altogether, except for casting a few nervous glances his way. He hadn't enjoyed flustering a woman like that in a long time. Most of the women he ran across threw themselves at him, so she had been a refreshing change.<br><br>Like his cousin Tom, the town manager here in Serenity, Travis had been a college baseball standout. Then he'd gone pro and spent a few years being traded around to various farm teams before finally making it to the majors with the Boston Red Sox. It had nearly killed his Southern, blueblood family to have him playing for a team up North. The only thing worse, in their opinion, would have been if he'd signed with the Yankees.<br><br></p><h2>The Democratic Forest</h2><p>Creates arresting imagery from the details of everyday life from the American South to the Berlin Wall, making use of the objective, dispassionate, or democratic attitudes of the camera lens</p><p>Fascinated by the commonplace, the author ( William Eggleston's Guide ) portrays in these 150 color photographs obdurately ordinary objects with a candor and respect for place brought into focus by a subtle sense of decline. Storefronts in East Tennessee, Mississippi parking lots and vehicles traveling through the great leveled spaces of Atlanta highways let us dwell in the familiar and mundane. These down-to-earth pictures tell their elegies in a muted voice, catching the eye with details: light and shade revive deteriorating brick and shape a roadside fruit stall and van into muscular bulk.

Reprint.</p><p>Jennings (Spangle, etc.) takes over 900 pages to tell the epic story of Thorn, a fifth-century Goth wanderer who becomes friend and counselor to Theodoric the Great, the Ostrogoth king who temporarily revitalized the decaying Roman Empire. Thorn, a most unusual hero indeed, is a hermaphrodite. While Thorn's dual sexuality may prove off-putting to some readers, particularly because of his many and often graphic sexual encounters (even though most are recounted with good humor and sly wit), his nature does provide for some interesting perspective on events. He learns of his unique nature when he is raped in a monastery and then becomes himself a seducer in a convent, all at the age of 12 and all without knowing exactly what he's doing. Sent packing, Thorn spends valuable time as companion to a crafty and knowledgeable old Roman centurion-turned-woodsman and a winter passing himself off as a rich nobleman in a city on the edge of the Empire (learning to exploit both his male and female aspects all the while). When he finally joins his countrymen, the Ostrogoths, he discovers that their young king, Theodoric, was the stranger who saved his life in the woods after he was bitten by a poisonous snake. Thorn immediately enlists in Theodoric's cause and serves him throughout his historic conquest. His ability to act as either man or woman serves him, his king, and their cause very well indeed. In the most improbable adventure of all, he encounters an evil ``twin'' who shares his sexual duality. An impressive, often violent saga that allows readers to experience a richly re-created time and place through the eyes of a hero unlike virtually any other in fact or fiction. Along the way, it also offers some thought-provoking critiques on Christianity and its origins. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In the opening pages of Jennings's ( Aztec ) massive, audacious historical novel about the Gothic conquest of the Roman Empire, Thorn, the hermaphrodite hero/heroine, is seduced first by a monk and then by a nun. Evicted from a monastery and a convent, Thorn is then schooled in the ways of the world by the grumpy, blasphemous woodsman Wyrd. Rugged yet sensitive, usually dressed as a man, Thorn is to elim fragment raptorial (i.e., predatory) in his thirst for lovers, male and female, and for adventure. He serves as field marshal, sidekick and spy for bloody Theodoric (A.D. 454-526), king of the Ostrogoths, depicted here as a benevolent despot. For all its sexual titillation and gory battles, this majestically paced epic with its unconventional hero consistently rewards as it leads readers through exotic byways of the fragmented Roman Empire, delving into pagan customs, Christian mysteries, corruption, slavery and the tolerant Arianism embraced by the Goths but condemned by the Catholic Church as a heresy. Through the androgynous Thorn, attuned to the war betwen the masculine and feminine sides of his nature, Jennings subtly explores the gender-based roles imposed by society. Spiced with medieval flavor, the novel will captivate readers willing to commit themselves to a long, detailed, sometimes ploddingly written but ultimately intoxicating narrative. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Witches Abroad (Discworld)</h2><p>The twelfth Discworld novel &#x2014; It seemed an easy job . . .

This book breaks new ground by focusing on the source and nature of Paul's spirituality. Taking his cue from Paul's express desire to "know nothing but Christ crucified," Michael Gorman shows how Paul's personal experience of God constantly intersects with the story of the cross, an event that both reveals the cruciform character of God and shapes believers into a community of "cruciformity" (conformity to the crucified Christ).<br><br> Expertly combining biblical studies and theological reflection, this noteworthy volume presents a model of the Christian life marked by faith, love, power, and hope.</p><p>Michael J. Gorman holds the Raymond E. Brown Chair in Biblical Studies and Theology at St. Mary&#39;s Seminary and University, Baltimore, Maryland. A highly regarded New Testament scholar, he has also written Reading Revelation Responsibly: Uncivil Worship and Witness and Elements of Biblical Exegesis: A Basic Guide for Students and Ministers.<b>M. Robert Mulholland</b><br>"Both scholarly stimulation and spiritual nurturing are to be found in reading this book. Michael Gorman masterfully conjoins knowledge and vital piety -- a conjunction noted more for its absence than its presence in the academy today. Gorman interacts creatively and effectively with past and current scholarship on Paul and Pauline theology, and he provides cogent arguments against some of the special-interest readings of Paul. This book has the potential to challenge both the academy and the church to a reconsideration of Paul that could revolutionize Pauline scholarship and transform the life of the church in the world." <br><br><b>Frank J. Matera</b><br>"Michael Gorman has provided us with a splendid account of a forgotten factor in Pauline studies -- the origin and meaning of the apostle's spirituality. Clearly written and carefully researched, this work illustrates how the cross of Christ is the key to Paul's spirituality -- and to our own as well."<br><br><b>Stephen E. Fowl</b><br>"In Cruciformity Michael Gorman rigorously works through the ways in which Paul narrates himself into the ongoing drama of God's salvation revealed in the cross and resurrection. Gorman's accessible prose nicely displays how Paul comes to understand and embody a life that seeks to be conformed to the cross of Christ. In an age when spirituality is often simply a mask for self- projection and self-assertion, Gorman's Paul reminds Christians that such vital matters as faith, hope, love, and power should be shaped by the story of the crucified and resurrected one rather than by our own whims and desires. This book is readable and timely, and it will enhance the lives of contemporary Christians."<br><br><b><i>America</i></b><br>"This scholarly work would make good reading during Lent and Holy Week."<br><br><b><i>Pacifica</i></b><br>"This is a good read, and not only for those interested in Pauline studies or Christian spirituality. . . In an undemanding style without assuming detailed knowledge of Paul's letters on the part of the reader, it makes a good general introduction to the apostle's theology."</p><h2>Naples &#39;44</h2><p>As a young intelligence officer stationed in Naples following its liberation from Nazi forces, Norman Lewis recorded the lives of a proud and vibrant people forced to survive on prostitution, thievery, and a desperate belief in miracles and cures. The most popular of Lewis&#39;s twenty-seven books, Naples &#39;44 is a landmark poetic study of the agony of wartime occupation and its ability to bring out the worst, and often the best, in human nature. In prose both heartrending and comic, Lewis describes an era of disillusionment, escapism, and hysteria in which the Allied occupiers mete out justice unfairly and fail to provide basic necessities to the populace while Neapolitan citizens accuse each other of being Nazi spies, women offer their bodies to the same Allied soldiers whose supplies they steal for sale on the black market, and angry young men organize militias to oppose &#34;temporary&#34; foreign rule. Yet over the chaotic din, Lewis sings intimately of the essential dignity of the Neapolitan people, whose traditions of civility, courage, and generosity of spirit shine through daily. This essential World War II book is as timely a read as ever.</p><p>Norman Lewis is Britain&#39;s greatest living travel writer, with a list of some 10 travel books and several books of collected journalism to his name. However Lewis regards his greatest achievement to have been the reaction to his article Genocide in Brazil, published in The Sunday Times in 1968. It led to a change in Brazilian law relating to the treatment of the Indians and to the formation of Survival International which fights for the survival of indigenous peoples everywhere.&#34;One goes on reading page after page like eating cherries.&#34;</p><h2>Old Fishing Lures and Tackle, Identification and Value Guide (Old Fishing Lures &amp; Tackle)</h2><p>Luckey updates his popular title with more information and prices, plus expanded coverage of plastic lures.

"When you can feel in your cells that you're coming to the end of your tour of duty," he said, "what is the spiritual work of this time, and how do we prepare for the mystery?"</p><p>Davidson, who has a seeker's heart and a skeptic's mind, jumped at the chance to spend time with him. She'd long feared that death would be a complete annihilation, while Reb Zalman felt certain that "something continues." He said he didn't want to convince her of anything. "What I want is to loosen your mind." Through their talks, he wanted to help people "not freak out about dying," and enable them to have a more heightened and grateful life.</p><p>For two years, they met every week, and this is Davidson's memoir of what they learned and how they changed. Interspersed with their talks are sketches from Reb Zalman's extraordinary life. He barely escaped the Nazis, became an Orthodox rabbi in the US, was married four times and had eleven children, one from a sperm donation to a lesbian rabbi, and formed friendships with leaders of other faiths, such as Thomas Merton and the Dalai Lama. Breaking with the Orthodox, he founded the Jewish Renewal Movement to encourage people to have a direct experience of God.</p><p>During their time together, Davidson was nearly killed by a suicide bomb, and Reb Zalman struggled with a steep decline in health. Together they created strategies to deal with pain and memory loss, and found tools to cultivate simplicity, fearlessness, and joy&#x2014;at any age. Davidson includes twelve exercises so that readers may experience what she did&#x2014;a sea change in facing what we all must face: mortality.</p></p><p><p>In 2009, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Sara Davidson was surprised by a call from Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, asking her to engage with him in what he called "The December Project."

As the essential life-force of the body, the breath influences how we feel on every level.&nbsp;&nbsp;But many traditional breathing programs are limited by esoteric or cultlike elements.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pioneering therapist Gay Hendricks has refined the most important practices into a mainstream healing tool that can provide dramatic benefits--ranging from lowered blood pressure and pain reduction to elimination of depression and anxiety--in as little as ten minutes a day. At the core of the book are eight key breathing exercises, fully illustrated, with step-by-step instructions, plus the "short form" ten-minute breathing program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional chapters provide breathing techniques for special concerns, including: Breathing to aid in trauma release and recovery from addictions. Treatment of asthma and other respiratory problems. Enhancement of sex and communication between couples. Improved concentration and stamina in sports.</p><p><b>Gay Hendricks, Ph. D.</b> is a pioneer in the field of body-centered psychotherapy, a nationally known teacher and seminar leader, and the author or co-author of over twenty books on psychology and education. Among his bestselling titles are two books co-authored with his wife Kathlyn, <i>Conscious Loving </i> and <i>At the Speed of Life</i>. Dr. Hendricks lives in Santa Barbara, California.<br>We inhale 20,000 times a day. Deprived of oxygen for more than 10 seconds, the brain fogs and panics; after 4 to 5 minutes, it never again functions with its former efficiency. Hendricks first traces the physiological journey of a breath, then lists the benefits of conscious breathing. Reportedly, it reduces stress and tension; increases energy and endurance; facilitates emotional mastery, particularly over anxiety and depression; prevents and heals certain physical complaints, especially asthma, respiratory problems, and cardiovascular illness; contributes significantly to "graceful aging" ; helps in managing pain; enhances mental focus and physical performance, particularly when applied to sports; and enables psychospiritual transformation. "Ultimately," Hendricks asserts, "breathing can be a path to that most essential of human experiences: learning to love." Thereafter, his amply illustrated book provides basic and advanced breath-work lessons and a 10-minute daily breathing program. Calling himself his "own best client," Hendricks builds a convincing case for his addition to alternative-healing therapies. <i>Whitney Scott</i></p><h2>Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Vol. 2</h2><p>A WORLD OF MODERN MECHA AND MAGIC<br><br>Syaoran, Fai, Kurogane, and Mokona venture to the Hanshin Republic to find one of the missing pieces of Sakura&#x2019;s memory, transformed into magically powerful feathers.

Johnson, a noted lecturer and Jungian analyst, is also the author of <em>He, She, We, Inner Work, Ecstasy, Transformation,</em> and <em>Owning Your Own Shadow. </em></p>The shadow in Jungian psychology is the unconscious dumping ground for undesirable characteristics of personality. "Owning" the shadow--accepting it as part of one's self--is seen as the first step toward wholeness. Using examples from history, mythology, and religion, Johnson, author of Inner Work ( LJ 7/86) and Transformation ( LJ 8/91), offers a tour of the shadow, showing its origin and features, and demonstrating how and why it bursts into consciousness when least expected. Returning to the subject of his earlier work We ( LJ 2/1/84), the author reveals how experience of romantic love may lead to awareness of both positive and negative aspects of the shadow, and how integrating the shadow into one's personality can be a challenging religious experience.

I lacked confidence, and progress was slow. Then, out of the blue, I was made a gift of a story, &#x201c;a story just like a novel.&#x201d; What is more, the story was meant for me alone. It concerned a man whom I knew, or rather whom my family knew, in New York at one time. This was no ordinary man. Leaving Japan with nothing, he arrived in the United States and made a fortune there, literally realizing the American dream. His life had taken on the status of legend among Japanese communities in New York&#x2014;yet no one knew that he&#x2019;d had another life back in Japan, one marked by the poverty-stricken period that followed World War II. The tale of that life would almost certainly have disappeared, lost in the stream of time, if a young Japanese man who happened to hear it had not then crossed the Pacific and hand-delivered it to me in Palo Alto, like a precious offering. Of course, the preciousness of his offering was something the young man never knew. As far as he could tell, he merely traveled on his own initiative, sought me out of his own accord, then went away when he&#x2019;d told the story he wanted to tell. Yet I felt as if some invisible power had arranged to bring this messenger to me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took all night to tell me the story. Outside, the heaviest rainstorm in California for decades raged, trapping us in the house. The angry power of nature must have affected my nerves: when he had finished, I was in shock. It felt uncanny that I should have known someone who had lived such a life&#x2014;and that, by a strange series of coincidences, his tale should have been delivered to me, and me alone.</p><h2>Your Money or Your Life: Transforming Your Relationship With Money and Achieving Financial Independence</h2><p>A guide to financial freedom outlines a nine-step program for looking at money in a whole new way, showing readers how to get out of debt, develop savings, reorder their material priorities, and achieve financial intelligence.</p><p>There's a big difference between "making a living" and making a life.

Every believer, Reformed or not, will profit from a thoughtful reading of Grace Unknown.<br>Few evangelical Christians today understand Reformed theology. They know it has something to do with predestination, and they may have heard of "the five points." But they can't name these points, and they think no one believes most of them anymore.<br>R. C. says there's more to Reformed theology than these five points , so he devotes the first half of Grace Unknown to its most foundational doctrines. In the second half he explains each of the five points, showing their source in Scripture and their coherence with each other.<br>Reformed theology reveals just how awesome the grace of God is. This doctrine has eluded so many evangelical Christians that true grace is, in some respects, unknown. In Grace Unknown R. C. explains "the heart of Reformed theology" and makes plain the reality of God's amazing grace.</p><p>R. C.

Written to celebrate the nonsense master's 82nd birthday, it follows "you" (an elderly gent in a suit and white moustache) through a physical check-up in some fiendish geriatric clinic. You are measured, prodded, and subjected to all the medical indignities familiar and unfamiliar to the elderly. "You must see Dr. Pollen, our Allergy Whiz, who knows every sniffle and itch that there is... He will check your reactions to thumbtacks and glue, catcher's mitts, leaf mould, and cardigans too. Nasturtiums and marble cake, white and blue chalks, anthracite coal and the feathers of hawks." It's clear that the process is going to be long, but much shorter than the bill. The blurb on the back says it all: "Is this a children's book? Well... not immediately. You buy a copy for your child now and you give it to him on his 70th birthday." Actually, it would make an amusing gift for anyone over 40. <i>--Richard Farr</i>Dr. Seuss lightens the aches and pains of growing old with his inimitable wit and wisdom.

As I crossed the long entrance hall of Monk's Piece on my way from the dining room, where we had just enjoyed the first of the happy, festive meals, toward the drawing room and the fire around which my family were now assembled, I paused and then, as I often do in the course of an evening, went to the front door, opened it and stepped outside.<br><br>I have always liked to take a breath of the evening, to smell the air, whether it is sweetly scented and balmy with the flowers of midsummer, pungent with the bonfires and leaf-mold of autumn, or crackling cold from frost and snow. I like to look about me at the sky above my head, whether there are moon and stars or utter blackness, and into the darkness ahead of me; I like to listen for the cries of nocturnal creatures and the moaning rise and fall of the wind, or the pattering of rain in the orchard trees, I enjoy the rush of air toward me up the hill from the flat pastures of the river valley.<br><br>Tonight, I smelled at once, and with a lightening heart, that there had been a change in the weather. All the previous week, we had had rain, chilling rain and a mist that lay low about the house and over the countryside. From the windows, the view stretched no farther than a yard or two down the garden. It was wretched weather, never seeming to come fully light, and raw, too. There had been no pleasure in walking, the visibility was too poor for any shooting and the dogs were permanently morose and muddy. Inside the house, the lamps were lit throughout the day and the walls of larder, outhouse and cellar oozed damp and smelled sour, the fires sputtered and smoked, burning dismally low.<br><br>My spirits have for many years now been excessively affected by the ways of the weather, and I confess that, had it not been for the air of cheerfulness and bustle that prevailed in the rest of the house, I should have been quite cast down in gloom and lethargy, unable to enjoy the flavor of life as I should like and irritated by my own susceptibility. But Esm� is merely stung by inclement weather into a spirited defiance, and so the preparations for our Christmas holiday had this year been more than usually extensive and vigorous.<br><br>I took a step or two out from under the shadow of the house so that I could see around me in the moonlight. Monk's Piece stands at the summit of land that rises gent-ly up for some four hundred feet from where the little River Nee traces its winding way in a north to south direction across this fertile, and sheltered, part of the country. Below us are pastures, interspersed with small clumps of mixed, broadleaf woodland. But at our backs for several square miles it is a quite different area of rough scrub and heathland, a patch of wildness in the midst of well-farmed country. We are but two miles from a good- sized village, seven from the principal market town, yet there is an air of remoteness and isolation which makes us feel ourselves to be much further from civilization.<br><br>I first saw Monk's Piece one afternoon in high summer, when out driving in the trap with Mr. Bentley. Mr. Bentley was formerly my employer, but I had lately risen to become a full partner in the firm of lawyers to which I had been articled as a young man (and with whom, indeed, I remained for my entire working life). He was at this time nearing the age when he had begun to feel inclined to let slip the reins of responsibility, little by little, from his own hands into mine, though he continued to travel up to our chambers in London at least once a week, until he died in his eighty-second year. But he was becoming more and more of a country-dweller. He was no man for shooting and fishing but, instead, he had immersed himself in the roles of country magistrate and churchwarden, governor of this, that and the other county and parish board, body and committee. I had been both relieved and pleased when finally he took me into full partnership with himself, after so many years, while at the same time believing the position to be no more than my due, for I had done my fair share of the donkey work and borne a good deal of the burden of responsibility for directing the fortunes of the firm with, I felt, inadequate reward-at least in terms of position.<br><br>So it came about that I was sitting beside Mr. Bentley on a Sunday afternoon, enjoying the view over the high hawthorn hedgerows across the green, drowsy countryside, as he let his pony take the road back, at a gentle pace, to his somewhat ugly and over-imposing manor house. It was rare for me to sit back and do nothing. In London I lived for my work, apart from some spare time spent in the study and collecting of watercolors. I was then thirty-five and I had been a widower for the past twelve years. I had no taste at all for social life and, although in good general health, was prone to occasional nervous illnesses and conditions, as a result of the experiences I will come to relate. Truth to tell, I was growing old well before my time, a somber, pale-complexioned man with a strained expression-a dull dog.<br><br>I remarked to Mr. Bentley on the calm and sweetness of the day, and after a sideways glance in my direction he said, "You should think of getting yourself something in this direction-why not? Pretty little cottage-down there, perhaps?" And he pointed with his whip to where a tiny hamlet was tucked snugly into a bend of the river below, white walls basking in the afternoon sunshine. "Bring yourself out of town some of these Friday afternoons, take to walking, fill yourself up with fresh air and good eggs and cream."<br><br>The idea had a charm, but only a distant one, seemingly unrelated to myself, and so I merely smiled and breathed in the warm scents of the grasses and the field flowers and watched the dust kicked up off the lane by the pony's hooves and thought no more about it. Until, that is, we reached a stretch of road leading past a long, perfectly proportioned stone house, set on a rise above a sweeping view down over the whole river valley and then for miles away to the violet-blue line of hills in the distance.<br><br>At that moment, I was seized by something I cannot precisely describe, an emotion, a desire-no, it was rather more, a knowledge, a simple certainty, which gripped me, and all so clear and striking that I cried out involuntarily for Mr. Bentley to stop, and, almost before he had time to do so, climbed out of the pony trap into the lane and stood on a grassy knoll, gazing first up at the house, so handsome, so utterly right for the position it occupied, a modest house and yet sure of itself, and then looking across at the country beyond. I had no sense of having been here before, but an absolute conviction that I would come here again, that the house was already mine, bound to me invisibly.<br><br>To one side of it, a stream ran between the banks toward the meadow beyond, whence it made its meandering way down to the river.<br><br>Mr. Bentley was now looking at me curiously, from the trap. "A fine place," he called.<br><br>I nodded, but, quite unable to impart to him any of my extreme emotions, turned my back upon him and walked a few yards up the slope from where I could see the entrance to the old, overgrown orchard that lay behind the house and petered out in long grass and tangled thicket at the far end. Beyond that, I glimpsed the perimeter of some rough- looking, open land. The feeling of conviction I have described was still upon me, and I remember that I was alarmed by it, for I had never been an imaginative or fanciful man and certainly not one given to visions of the future. Indeed, since those earlier experiences I had deliberately avoided all contemplation of any remotely nonmaterial matters, and clung to the prosaic, the visible and tangible.<br><br>Nevertheless, I was quite unable to escape the belief-nay, I must call it more, the certain knowledge-that this house was one day to be my own home, that sooner or later, though I had no idea when, I would become the owner of it. When finally I accepted and admitted this to myself, I felt on that instant a profound sense of peace and contentment settle upon me such as I had not known for very many years, and it was with a light heart that I returned to the pony trap, where Mr. Bentley was awaiting me more than a little curiously.<br><br>The overwhelming feeling I had experienced at Monk's Piece remained with me, albeit not in the forefront of my mind, when I left the country that afternoon to return to London. I had told Mr. Bentley that if ever he were to hear that the house was for sale, I should be eager to know of it.<br><br>Some years later, he did so. I contacted the agents that same day and hours later, without so much as returning to see it again, I had offered for it, and my offer was accepted. A few months prior to this, I had met Esm� Ainley. Our affection for one another had been increasing steadily, but, cursed as I still was by my indecisive nature in all personal and emotional matters, I had remained silent as to my intentions for the future. I had enough sense to take the news about Monk's Piece as a good omen, however, and a week after I had formally become the owner of the house, traveled into the country with Esm� and proposed marriage to her among the trees of the old orchard. This offer, too, was accepted and very shortly afterward we were married and moved at once to Monk's Piece. On that day, I truly believed that I had at last come out from under the long shadow cast by the events of the past and saw from his face and felt from the warmth of his handclasp that Mr. Bentley believed it too, and that a burden had been lifted from his own shoulders. He had always blamed himself, at least in part, for what had happened to me-it had, after all, been he who had sent me on that first journey up to Crythin Gifford, and Eel Marsh House, and to the funeral of Mrs. Drablow.<br><br>But all of that could not have been further from my conscious thought at least, as I stood taking in the night air at the door of my house, on that Christmas Eve. For some fourteen years now Monk's Piece had been the happiest of homes-Esm�'s and mine, and that of her four children by her first marriage, to Captain Ainley. In the early days I had come here only at weekends and holidays but London life and business began to irk me from the day I bought the place and I was glad indeed to retire permanently into the country at the earliest opportunity.<br><br>And, now, it was to this happy home that my family had once again repaired for Christmas. In a moment, I should open the front door and hear the sound of their voices from the drawing room-unless I was abruptly summoned by my wife, fussing about my catching a chill. Certainly, it was very cold and clear at last. The sky was pricked over with stars and the full moon rimmed with a halo of frost. The dampness and fogs of the past week had stolen away like thieves into the night, the paths and the stone walls of the house gleamed palely and my breath smoked on the air.<br><br>Upstairs, in the attic bedrooms, Isobel's three young sons-Esm�'s grandsons-slept, with stockings tied to their bedposts. There would be no snow for them on the morrow, but Christmas Day would at least wear a bright and cheerful countenance.<br><br>There was something in the air that night, something, I suppose, remembered from my own childhood, together with an infection caught from the little boys, that excited me, old as I was. That my peace of mind was about to be disturbed, and memories awakened that I had thought forever dead, I had, naturally, no idea. That I should ever again renew my close acquaintance, if only in the course of vivid recollections and dreams, with mortal dread and terror of spirit, would have seemed at that moment impossible.<br><br>I took one last look at the frosty darkness, sighed contentedly, called to the dogs, and went in, anticipating nothing more than a pipe and a glass of good malt whisky beside the crackling fire, in the happy company of my family. As I crossed the hall and entered the drawing room, I felt an uprush of well-being, of the kind I have experienced regularly during my life at Monk's Piece, a sensation that leads on naturally to another, of heartfelt thankfulness. And indeed I did give thanks, at the sight of my family ensconced around the huge fire which Oliver was at that moment building to a perilous height and a fierce blaze with the addition of a further great branch of applewood from an old tree we had felled in the orchard the previous autumn. Oliver is the eldest of Esm�'s sons, and bore then, as now, a close resemblance both to his sister Isobel (seated beside her husband, the bearded Aubrey Pearce) and to the brother next in age, Will. All three of them have good, plain, open English faces, inclined to roundness and with hair and eyebrows and lashes of a light chestnut brown-the color of their mother's hair before it became threaded with gray.<br><br>At that time, Isobel was only twenty-four years old but already the mother of three young sons, and set fair to produce more. She had the plump, settled air of a matron and an inclination to mother and oversee her husband and brothers as well as her own children. She had been the most sensible, responsible of daughters, she was affectionate and charming, and she seemed to have found, in the calm and level- headed Aubrey Pearce, an ideal partner. Yet at times I caught Esm� looking at her wistfully, and she had more than once voiced, though gently and to me alone, a longing for Isobel to be a little less staid, a little more spirited, even frivolous.<br><br>In all honesty, I could not have wished it so. I would not have wished for anything to ruffle the surface of that calm, untroubled sea.<br><br>Oliver Ainley, at that time nineteen, and his brother Will, only fourteen months younger, were similarly serious, sober young men at heart, but for the time being they still enjoyed all the exuberance of young puppies, and indeed it seemed to me that Oliver showed rather too few signs of maturity for a young man in his first year at Cambridge and destined, if my advice prevailed with him, for a career at the Bar. Will lay on his stomach before the fire, his face aglow, chin propped upon his hands. Oliver sat nearby, and from time to time a scuffle of their long legs would break out, a kicking and shoving, accompanied by a sudden guffawing, for all the world as if they were ten years old all over again.</p><h2>More Than A Carpenter</h2><p>With almost ten million copies in print, <i>More Than a Carpenter</i> continues to be the most powerful evangelism tool worldwide. Josh McDowell's timeless examination of the true nature of Christ and his impact on our lives is one of the best-selling Christian books ever. Written by a former skeptic of Christianity, it is a hard-hitting book for those who doubt Jesus' deity and his purpose.</p><p>Since its release, <i>More Than a Carpenter</i> has been challenging readers to ask the question, "Who is Jesus?" Author and renowned speaker Josh McDowell acknowledges that while the topic of God is widely accepted, the name of Jesus often causes irritation. "Why don't the names of Buddha, Mohammed, Confucius offend people? The reason is that these others didn't claim to be God, but Jesus did." By addressing questions about scientific and historical evidence, the validity of the Bible, and proofs of the resurrection, McDowell helps the reader come to an informed and intelligent decision about whether Jesus was a liar, a lunatic, or the Lord. This short, 128-page gem does not employ fancy theological words, forsaking the layman, but reads more like an intimate research document laying out the facts with veracious accuracy, from reliable sources ranging from secular scientists to conservative seminarians. A skeptic himself for many years, McDowell always believed that Christians were "out of their minds" but now insists that "never has an individual been called upon to commit intellectual suicide in trusting Christ as Savior and Lord." McDowell adeptly articulates fundamental answers to poignant questions that cause the skeptic to consider whether Jesus was a liar causing countless martyrs to die in his wake, a lunatic deserving death, or actually the Lord of the universe. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>The story that could change your life. Skeptic Josh McDowell thought Christians were out of their minds. He ridiculed and insulted them, then decided to combat them with his own thorough research to disprove the claims of Jesus Christ. To his surprise, he discovered that the evidence suggested exactly the opposite-that Jesus, instead of being simply a first-century Hebrew carpenter, truly was the God he claimed to be. Since its original publication, More Than a Carpenter has sold over 20 million copies and changed countless lives. Now, in this revised and updated edition, Josh is joined by his son, Sean, as they tackle the questions that today&#39;s generation continues to ask: &#34;Can I be spiritual without believing in God?&#34; &#34;How can I make sure that my life counts for something?&#34; &#34;Is it really possible to know anything for sure about God or Jesus?&#34; Read the story. Weigh the facts. Experience his love. And then watch what happens.</p><h2>The Good Life: The Autobiography Of Tony Bennett</h2><p>The renowned recording artist shares a half-century of personal memories, from his childhood in Depression-era Queens, to the New York jazz scene of the 1940s, to his successes with a new generation of fans in the 1990s</p><p>Tony Bennett lives in New York City. A book of his paintings, <i>Tony Bennett: What My Heart Has Seen,</i> was published in 1996.<p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> My paternal grandfather, Giovanni Benedetto, who died before my father was born, grew up in the small, isolated village of Podargoni in Calabria, Italy. </p><p> Because the Benedetto family originally came from the north of Italy, they were fair-skinned and fair-haired, like northern Europeans, and quite unlike their fellow dark-haired, dark-skinned Calabrese. My father's mother, Maria, was so fair that she was known as "La Germanesa," the German woman. The Benedettos were essentially poor farmers, producing olive oil, figs, and wine grapes. My mother's side of the family was named Suraci, and they also made their living farming in Calabria. Like everyone else in the region, they were unable to read and write. </p><p> My paternal grandmother and my maternal grandmother were sisters. Maria Suraci married Giovanni Benedetto, and they became my father's parents, and Vincenza Suraci married Antonio Suraci (who by coincidence had the same last name), and they became my mother's parents. </p><p> My father, Giovanni (John) Benedetto, was born in 1895. The youngest of five children, he was named after my grandfather. When my grandmother was pregnant with my father, she dreamt that her late husband came to her from the "other side" and told her to name the boy "Giovanni," after him. </p><p> Italians at that time were very superstitious. My father was very sickly as a child, and although they didn't know it then, we later found out that he had suffered from rheumatic fever. But as family lore has it, everyone attributed his aches and pains to the fact that my grandmother grieved for her dead husband while she was pregnant, and her grieving had made my father a sickly child. The older people in the village served as the only available "doctors," and they made their diagnoses based more on old-fashioned superstition than on medicine. Nobody went to the hospital -- there weren't any -- and the only remedies were home remedies. </p><p> Despite the problems with his health, my father was essentially a joyful child. My Aunt Frances used to tell me that she often looked after my father while she and Grandma would be out working the land. They'd set my father down to play in the shade of the nearest tree. He'd smile happily and watch the blue sky above, and she'd never hear a peep out of him. From the beginning, I've been told, he loved music and song, and as a boy he had a wonderful singing voice. He would often climb to the top of the mountains in Calabria and sing out to the whole valley below. Singing is a part of my heritage. I'm convinced it's in my blood, and that's why I'm a singer today. </p><p> By the 1890s a widespread blight had forced thousands of farmers, including the Benedettos and Suracis, to leave their beloved homeland, and my mother's parents, Antonio and Vincenza Suraci, were the first of my relatives to make the trip to America. </p><p> The emigration of an entire family was a gradual process in those days. When they left Italy in late January 1899 with their two children, my Uncle Frank and my Aunt Mary, my grandmother was one month pregnant with my mother. When they arrived in New York, they had no relatives to greet them or show them the ropes. But some friends from their village had made the journey a few years earlier, and had written to tell them that they would have a place to live when they came over. </p><p> I consider my grandparents, as well as the many immigrants before and after them, to be the most courageous of people. It astounds me even to contemplate what it meant for them to leave behind everything they knew. They journeyed across the ocean without any idea of what they'd find on the other side, and none of them had ever ventured more than a few miles from the spot where they were born. It must have been terrifying, knowing that they would never see their childhood homes, or their own parents, again. </p><p> My grandparents packed up their essential belongings and took the train north to Naples. At the Naples Emigrant Aid Society they went through some minor processing and were then ferried out in a small boat to the middle of Naples Bay, where they boarded the huge steamship that would take them to America. </p><p> After three weeks crossing the Atlantic, the ship finally entered New York harbor and my grandparents put on their best clothes and stepped onto Ellis Island. There they were subjected to a series of humiliating and frightening questions put to them by the immigration inspectors. After they passed their physical examinations they were led into the great hall, where they waited for their names to be called. Because of the high rate of illiteracy, many new immigrants arrived without the right documents. The derogatory term "wop," an acronym for "With Out Papers," would be stamped on the forms of these unfortunates and officials would call out, "We have another 'wop.' Send him home." I can only imagine how my grandparents felt, not knowing whether they might at any moment be rejected and sent back to Italy. </p><p> But fortunately my grandparents at last heard their names called, had their entry papers stamped, and were loaded onto another small boat that took them to the southernmost tip of Manhattan Island at Battery Park. They made their way along the crowded streets to the address they had been given by their friends, a five-story tenement building at 139 Mulberry Street, and their first home in America. The following September, my mother, Anna Suraci, was born. She was the first of our family to be born in the United States. </p><p> Gradually my grandparents helped the rest of the family make it over. Once they found work, they sent money home to the family in Calabria to sponsor the rest of the family's passage. When the new arrivals got here, my grandparents took them into their home and helped them find jobs and a place to live. </p><p> At about the same time, my grandmother Maria Benedetto, now without a husband, began to contemplate joining her sister Vincenza in America. Most of the Benedetto family, including my Uncle Dominick, arrived in the early 1900s. Finally, in 1906, they sent for my grandmother and my father. </p><p> When the Benedettos arrived in New York, most of them settled, as had the Suracis, in Little Italy. Tenement buildings lined the narrow dirt streets and pushcarts crowded the sidewalks. The streets were packed shoulder to shoulder with crowds of people: men with big mustaches, wearing bowlers or Italian straw hats; women with their hair pulled back in a bun, wearing long dresses and brightly colored striped shawls and clutching woven baskets as they tested the street vendors' fruit and vegetables for that day's meal. Children were everywhere, playing in the muddy streets among the pushcarts, vendors, and the horses and carriages. This neighborhood was a far cry from the lush open fields of Calabria my family had left behind. </p><p> <br> Grandpa Antonio Suraci really lived the "American dream," and took full advantage of the opportunities offered to him in his new country. He moved the family to a quieter neighborhood on Twelfth Street on the East Side between First and Second Avenues. It was here that my grandfather started a wholesale fruit-and-vegetable business catering to the pushcart owners. Every morning they congregated at his basement warehouse before sunrise to pick up the produce they'd sell all across downtown New York. My grandfather got up early in the morning every day and worked until the sun went down. He wasn't much at numbers, so he let my grandmother handle all the money. At the end of the day he gave her whatever he'd earned, and she paid all the bills and stashed whatever was left over in an old trunk she kept hidden under their bed. They had a big family at this time. Although my Uncle Frank and Aunt Mary were out on their own, my grandparents still had five children living at home. </p><p> My mother, like my father, had also been a sickly child, and I guess because he though</p></p><h2>The Joy of Missing Out: Live More by Doing Less</h2><p><p><strong>Productivity expert and CEO of inkWELL Press Productivity Co.

While the fight for its acceptance has been a long and difficult one, after a century of struggle among the cognoscenti the battle is over. Biologists are now confident that their remaining questions, such as how life on Earth began, or how the Cambrian explosion could have produced so many new species in such a short time, will be found to have Darwinian answers. They, like most of the rest of us, accept Darwin's theory to be true.</p><p>But should we? What would happen if we found something that radically challenged the now-accepted wisdom? In <i>Darwin's Black Box,</i> Michael Behe argues that evidence of evolution's limits has been right under our noses -- but it is so small that we have only recently been able to see it. The field of biochemistry, begun when Watson and Crick discovered the double-helical shape of DNA, has unlocked the secrets of the cell. There, biochemists have unexpectedly discovered a world of Lilliputian complexity. As Behe engagingly demonstrates, using the examples of vision, bloodclotting, cellular transport, and more, the biochemical world comprises an arsenal of chemical machines, made up of finely calibrated, interdependent parts. For Darwinian evolution to be true, there must have been a series of mutations, each of which produced its own working machine, that led to the complexity we can now see. The more complex and interdependent each machine's parts are shown to be, the harder it is to envision Darwin's gradualistic paths, Behe surveys the professional science literature and shows that it is completely silent on the subject, stymied by the elegance of the foundation of life. Could it be that there is some greater force at work?</p><p>Michael Behe is not a creationist. He believes in the scientific method, and he does not look to religious dogma for answers to these questions. But he argues persuasively that biochemical machines must have been <i>designed</i> -- either by God, or by some other higher intelligence. For decades science has been frustrated, trying to reconcile the astonishing discoveries of modern biochemistry to a nineteenth-century theory that cannot accommodate them. With the publication of <i>Darwin's Black Box,</i> it is time for scientists to allow themselves to consider exciting new possibilities, and for the rest of us to watch closely.</p><p></p></p><p>Michael J. Behe, a biochemist at Lehigh University, presents here a scientific argument for the existence of God. Examining the evolutionary theory of the origins of life, he can go part of the way with Darwin--he accepts the idea that species have been differentiated by the mechanism of natural selection from a common ancestor. But he thinks that the essential randomness of this process can explain evolutionary development only at the macro level, not at the micro level of his expertise. Within the biochemistry of living cells, he argues, life is &#34;irreducibly complex.&#34; This is the last black box to be opened, the end of the road for science. Faced with complexity at this level, Behe suggests that it can only be the product of &#34;intelligent design.&#34;Michael J. Behe is Professor of Biochemistry at Lehigh University. He lives in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.<p></p></p><h2>Three Complete Novels: Battleground / Line Of Fire / Close Combat (The Corps)</h2><p>Three best-selling novels--Battleground, Line of Fire, and Close Combat--pay tribute to the men and women of the Marine Corps, combining military history with the courageous acts of fictional characters.</p><p>W.E.B.

While the gospel is exploding throughout the global south, Western civilization faces militant assaults from aggressive secularism and radical Islam. Will the church resist the seductive shaping power of advanced modernity? More than ever, Christians must resist the negative cultural forces of our day with fortitude and winsomeness. What is needed is followers of Christ who are willing to face reality without flinching and respond with a faithfulness that is unwavering. Os Guinness describes these Christians as "impossible people," those who have "hearts that can melt with compassion, but with faces like flint and backbones of steel who are unmanipulable, unbribable, undeterrable and unclubbable, without ever losing the gentleness, the mercy, the grace and the compassion of our Lord." Few accounts of the challenge of today are more realistic, and few calls to Christian courage are more timely, resolute&#x2015;and hopeful. Guinness argues that we must engage secularism and atheism in new ways, confronting competing ideas with discernment and fresh articulation of the faith. Christians are called to be impossible people, full of courage and mercy in challenging times.</p><p>Os Guinness (DPhil, Oxford) is the author or editor of more than thirty books, including <em>Renaissance, The Global Public Square, A Free People's Suicide</em> and <em>Fool's Talk</em>. He is a senior fellow at the Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics. A frequent speaker and prominent social critic, he has addressed audiences across the world. He lives near Washington, DC."The prolific Os Guinness, always with his finger on the pulse of our Western societies, considers the current state of our civilization, its fraying at the edges now more deeply tearing toward the center, and how Christians can and must be salt and light in this newly loosed menagerie. . . . Guinness lays out why we must enter this fray with the right tools, and also provides insight on how to use them." (Christian Renewal, August 24, 2016)<br><br>"His comprehensive grasp of history, philosophy, science, culture, and religion will give serious thinkers many hours of reflection. Guinness recommends solutions and he challenges believers to courageous action in defense of Christianity." (John Bernstein, Christian Market, August 2016)<br><br>"With his unique blend of incisive clarity and prophetic vision, Os Guinness has written a book that will challenge, encourage, and awaken us to live wholeheartedly for Christ in this 'grand clarifying moment.' I recommend <em>Impossible People</em> as a book for such a time as this." (Amy Orr-Ewing, director, The Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics)<br><br>"Every time I sit down to read the prophetic words of Os Guinness, I feel my spine strengthen and my mind perk up. His clear writing and earned wisdom bring both courage and uncertainty; for while we can't predict where our culture will head, we can rely on the truth that guides and emboldens every generation to meet the moment for which we've been called." (Gabe Lyons, founder of Q, author of Good Faith)<br><br>"Os Guinness is a prophet. Hear him." (Eric Metaxas, New York Times bestselling author of Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy)<br><br>"This remarkable book helps us to clearly see how Western modernity is trying to replace Christian faith with a progressive secularism. It is a timely wake-up call for the church to stand firm against this fatal challenge. I urge every Christian leader to read it." (Mouneer Anis, primate of the Anglican Province of Jerusalem and the Middle East)<br><br>"I read everything Os Guinness writes because he always challenges my thinking and enlarges my perspective. <em>Impossible People</em> may be his most important work. Read it, then buy five copies for friends and discuss it together. The message is that important. This could be the most important book you read this year." (Rick Warren, pastor, Saddleback Church, author of The Purpose Driven Life)<br><br>In his trademark fashion, Os Guinness takes on the biggest themes of the modern world, turns them on the church and its gospel, and challenges the church to be faithful, courageous and unflinching."

Much more than a children's story, the narrative is also a lesson on the precarious nature of freedom, a luxury too often taken for granted.

However, the paradox of parenting is that the more we learn about late adolescent development and risk, the more frightened we become for our children, and the more we want to stay involved in their lives. This becomes particularly necessary, and also particularly challenging, in mid- to late adolescence, the years just before and after students head off to college. These years coincide with the emergence of many mood disorders and other mental health issues.</p><p>When family psychologist Dr. B. Janet Hibbs's own son came home from college mired in a dangerous depressive spiral, she turned to Dr. Anthony Rostain. Dr. Rostain has a secret superpower: he understands the arcane rules governing privacy and parental involvement in students&#x2019; mental health care on college campuses, the same rules that sometimes hold parents back from getting good care for their kids. Now, these two doctors have combined their expertise to corral the crucial emotional skills and lessons that every parent and student can learn for a successful launch from home to college.</p></p><p><b>ANTHONY ROSTAIN</b>, M.D., M.A., is a nationally-recognized expert in child and adolescent psychiatry, and a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, and at the Children&#x2019;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). <b>B.

This wonderful book defines and explores the many, varied minefields of the college years with candor and compassion, and provides parents with practical advice and support about what to look for, what to ask and say, and when and how to intervene.

They&#x2019;ve also proven themselves uniquely adept in moving the conversation from diagnosis to treatment and prevention. This book is a must-read for college administrators, high school counselors, policymakers and above all, parents of students of all ages, who (if they&#x2019;re like me) will start implementing its insights long before they reach its end.

Look no further! Effective Java&#x2122;, Second Edition, brings together seventy-eight indispensable programmer&#x2019;s rules of thumb: working, best-practice solutions for the programming challenges you encounter every day. This highly anticipated new edition of the classic, Jolt Award-winning work has been thoroughly updated to cover Java SE 5 and Java SE 6 features introduced since the first edition. Bloch explores new design patterns and language idioms, showing you how to make the most of features ranging from generics to enums, annotations to autoboxing. Each chapter in the book consists of several &#x201c;items&#x201d; presented in the form of a short, standalone essay that provides specific advice, insight into Java platform subtleties, and outstanding code examples. The comprehensive descriptions and explanations for each item illuminate what to do, what not to do, and why. Highlights include: New coverage of generics, enums, annotations, autoboxing, the for-each loop, varargs, concurrency utilities, and much more Updated techniques and best practices on classic topics, including objects, classes, libraries, methods, and serialization How to avoid the traps and pitfalls of commonly misunderstood subtleties of the language Focus on the language and its most fundamental libraries: java.lang, java.util, and, to a lesser extent, java.util.concurrent and java.io Simply put, Effective Java&#x2122;, Second Edition, presents the most practical, authoritative guidelines available for writing efficient, well-designed programs.</p><p><p> <b>Joshua Bloch </b>is chief Java architect at Google and a Jolt Award winner. He was previously a distinguished engineer at Sun Microsystems and a senior systems designer at Transarc. Bloch led the design and implementation of numerous Java platform features, including JDK 5.0 language enhancements and the award-winning Java Collections Framework. He coauthored <i>Java&#x2122; Puzzlers </i>(Addison-Wesley, 2005) and <i>Java&#x2122; Concurrency in Practice </i>(Addison-Wesley, 2006).</p><p><b>Preface to the Second Edition</b></p> <p>A lot has happened to the Java platform since I wrote the first edition of this book in 2001, and it&#x2019;s high time for a second edition. The most significant set of changes was the addition of generics, enum types, annotations, autoboxing, and the for-each loop in Java 5. A close second was the addition of the new concurrency library, java.util.concurrent, also released in Java 5. With Gilad Bracha, I had the good fortune to lead the teams that designed the new language features. I also had the good fortune to serve on the team that designed and developed the concurrency library, which was led by Doug Lea.</p> <p>The other big change in the platform is the widespread adoption of modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans, and of static analysis tools, such as FindBugs. While I have not been involved in these efforts, I&#x2019;ve benefited from them immensely and learned how they affect the Java development experience.</p> <p>In 2004, I moved from Sun to Google, but I&#x2019;ve continued my involvement in the development of the Java platform over the past four years, contributing to the concurrency and collections APIs through the good offices of Google and the Java Community Process. I&#x2019;ve also had the pleasure of using the Java platform to develop libraries for use within Google. Now I know what it feels like to be a user.</p> <p>As was the case in 2001 when I wrote the first edition, my primary goal is to share my experience with you so that you can imitate my successes while avoiding my failures. The new material continues to make liberal use of real-world examples from the Java platform libraries.</p> <p>The first edition succeeded beyond my wildest expectations, and I&#x2019;ve done my best to stay true to its spirit while covering all of the new material that was required to bring the book up to date. It was inevitable that the book would grow, and grow it did, from fifty-seven items to seventy-eight. Not only did I add twenty-three items, but I thoroughly revised all the original material and retired a few items whose better days had passed. In the Appendix, you can see how the material in this edition relates to the material in the first edition.</p> <p>In the Preface to the First Edition, I wrote that the Java programming language and its libraries were immensely conducive to quality and productivity, and a joy to work with. The changes in releases 5 and 6 have taken a good thing and made it better. The platform is much bigger now than it was in 2001 and more complex, but once you learn the patterns and idioms for using the new features, they make your programs better and your life easier. I hope this edition captures my continued enthusiasm for the platform and helps make your use of the platform and its new features more effective and enjoyable.</p> <p> <i>San Jose, California<br>April 2008</i> </p></p><h2>The Abilene Paradox and Other Meditations on Management</h2><p>Faulty decision-making can have dire consequences, and when it comes to group decisions, the challenges are even greater.

Despite burgeoning sociocultural diversity, many early childhood classrooms (pre-K to grade 2) offer a one-size-fits-all curriculum in which learning is too often assessed by standardized tests. In contrast, Genishi and Dyson proclaim <em>diversity as the new norm</em>. They feature stories of children whose language learning is impossible to standardize and teachers who do not follow scripts. These master teachers observe, informally assess, respond to, and grow <em>with</em> their students&#x2015;some of whom are rapid language learners and some of whom become speakers, readers, and writers at &#x201c;child speed.&#x201d; Much of this learning, regardless of tempo, is found within the language-rich contexts of play. </p> <p>Chapters focus on children&#x2019;s ways of communicating through varied modes, including the use of nonverbal expression; languages such as Spanish, English, and the variant of English known as African American Language; and multiple media. Throughout the text there is a resistance to labels such as &#x201c;at risk&#x201d; and a much-needed advocacy for child-sensible practices in a world where diversity is indeed the &#x201c;new norm.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p><br> &#x201c;Genishi and Dyson animate sociocultural theories of language learning by inviting us into the intimacy of children&#x2019;s worlds.

When Sadhguru uses the word 'Adiyogi', he can mean either 'that which is not', or Shiva, the first ever Yogi who perceived that emptiness experientially, and in Sadhguru's own experience, they are not separate and he travels seamlessly between these two definitions. Chronicles, some of which are in the form of myths, occupy a prominent position in this book and if one goes with the intellect to discern it, one will miss the point entirely. Miss Subramaniam, the co- author of the book, is there as a representative of a contemporary society where psychological realities reign supreme. Saying that, she has played her part really well, as she very briefly sketches her own personal journey from a once skeptic disciple to the one who now leans on the bedrock of trust laid out by her guru, atleast on spiritual matters, notwithstanding the occasional thought waves of onslaught instigated by her mind, like the majority of us. The last section of the book is in the form of a dialogue where Arundhathi asks Sadhguru regarding the need of this particular book, how the various categorisations of Adiyogi as a mythological, metaphysical,cosmological and existential figure adds up in the long run, and above all, how Sadhguru's own inner experiences helps in presenting this complex phenomenon before a person living in this age. Arundhathi's language and vocabulary deserves a special applause as she is comfortably placed in the good books of all dictionaries --By Agasthyan on 1 March 2017<br><br>This is a one of kind book, exploring Shiva in a unique way. My neighbour has already borrowed it to read. I had time only to read the first chapter will give a detailed review once my neighbour returns it. --By Subbu on 3 March 2017<br><br>The courier service was great. I am loving reading the book. It feels like another mystic musings...I cannot review the book as a whole yet but until now it is spellbinding experience for me. Arundhati Subramanayam has cleared all the kind of scepticism that can bud in one's mind. --By Amazon Customer on 2 March 2017</p><h2>A People and Their Quilts</h2><p>Quilts are a reflection of the people who make, use, and cherish them through the years. John Rice Irwin has personally conducted interviews with hundreds of old-time quiltmakers, some of whom were over one hundred years old. Detailed photographs taken by Pulitzer Prize winner Robin Hood depict an opulent conglomeration of quilts, from the community quilt which became known as the Murder Quilt. More importantly, Irwin looks under the quilts, at the lives of the people who created and used them. He explores their ambitions and aspirations, their struggles and disappointments. From the young ladies of Salem Valley who pieced a quilt for the town&#39;s most eligible bachelor in the hope that one of them would sleep under it, to the retired physician who began quilting in his late sixties to fill his spare time, Irwin presents their stories with compassion and candor. This lavishly illustrated volume is a treasure trove of creative needlework, colorful anecdotes, and intriguing personal histories which will entertain readers of all ages.</p><p>John Irwin is an educator-historian and one of the area&#39;s leading authorities on the pioneer-frontier culture. He is the founder and director of the nationally-known Museum of Appalachia in Norris, Tennessee.</p><h2>My Brother&#39;s Book</h2><p><p>Fifty years after <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em> was published comes the last book Maurice Sendak completed before his death in May 2012, <em>My Brother's Book</em>. With influences from Shakespeare and William Blake, Sendak pays homage to his late brother, Jack, whom he credited for his passion for writing and drawing. Pairing Sendak's poignant poetry with his exquisite and dramatic artwork, this book redefines what mature readers expect from Maurice Sendak while continuing the lasting legacy he created over his long, illustrious career. Sendak's tribute to his brother is an expression of both grief and love and will resonate with his lifelong fans who may have read his children's books and will be ecstatic to discover something for them now. Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning literary critic and Shakespearean scholar Stephen Greenblatt contributes a moving introduction.</p></p><p><p></p><p><strong>Maurice Sendak</strong>&#x2019;s children&#x2019;s books have sold over 30 million copies and have been translated into more than 40 languages.

She&nbsp;kept lions as pets, was awarded the Legion of Honor by Empress Eug�nie, and befriended &#x201c;Buffalo Bill&#x201d; Cody. She became a painter at a time when women were often only reluctantly educated as artists. Her unconventional artistic work habits, including visiting slaughterhouses to sketch an animal&#x2019;s anatomy and wearing men&#x2019;s clothing to gain access to places like a horse fair, where women were not allowed, helped her become one of the most beloved female painters of her time.

Food has always been at the heart of my family, and it played a big role in my upbringing. We celebrated, bonded, commiserated, and loved one another through food&#x2014;and not necessarily the healthy kind. Our hometown favorites were fried chicken, fajita tacos, BBQ burgers, BBQ ribs, fried shrimp, and po&#x2019;boy sandwiches. Growing up, I was always on the move and didn&#x2019;t always make the right choices when it came to food and may have even developed some habits around it that were silently sabotaging my health as I grew older.<p>After having my daughter, I made a conscious effort to regain control of my health and my body. But I didn&#x2019;t want to do a crash diet. I was a mom now. I needed to change my ways and set an example for my child. So I turned to no one other than my good friend and fitness and nutrition confidant, Marco Borges. I&#x2019;ve worked with him for years to keep me on-track, motivated, and ahead of the health game. Yet, as much as I follow and trust his advice, when I would hear him talk about the amazing benefits of a plant-based lifestyle, I would think, that sounds amazing. I would love to experience those benefits, and while I can incorporate those good foods into my life, I knew I could never eat that way. I love food too much. Something needed to happen for me to come around. I needed to be ready.</p><p>A year later (around November 2013), my husband and I decided we wanted to try a completely plant-based diet with Marco. I had lost my pregnancy weight with his help, through an exercise-and-nutrition program, and was ready for another challenge. I decided I wanted to take a more proactive role in my health, and knowing all the amazing benefits, I knew this was the one. I was ready.</p><p>And so the journey began that helped me get into the best shape of my life. Little did I know the long-lasting effects it would have. I thought, like with most diets, I would feel deprived and hate food, that I would miss out on restaurants and celebrations, that I would get headaches and be irritable, etc. I was wrong about all of that. It took a few days to adjust, but what I discovered was increased energy, better sleep, weight loss, improved digestion, clarity, and an incredibly positive feeling for my actions and the effects it would have on those around me and the environment. I couldn&#x2019;t believe how much of our health we can control with food. And that I <i>could</i> still love food but this time it would love me back (like the walnut tacos you&#x2019;ll find in here, oh my!!). We even celebrated my husband&#x2019;s birthday with an all-vegan party. I can still see the reaction on our friend&#x2019;s faces. Some were extremely excited while others had some reservations, but in the end, we all enjoyed it immensely. My greatest discovery was that I would benefit from the best gift I could give myself and my family&#x2014;my health.</p><p>I&#x2019;m sharing my experience because I want the best for everyone, and I would like for anyone who thinks that this isn&#x2019;t for them, even though they may know of the incredible benefits, that they <i>can </i>do it. You deserve to give yourself the best life you can. Empowerment starts within you and your decisions. You can control the quality of your life with the food you eat. The truth is that if a Houston-born foodie like me can do it, you can too&#x2014;you just need to try it for 22 days.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;Beyonc�</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p><b>I WELCOME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO </b>write the introduction to this important book, as awareness is the first step in healing.</p><p>For almost four decades, my colleagues and I at the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute and the University of California, San Francisco have conducted clinical research proving the many benefits of comprehensive lifestyle changes. These include:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;a whole-foods, plant-based diet (naturally low in fat and refined carbohydrates) like the one described in this book;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;stress-management techniques (including yoga and meditation);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;moderate exercise (such as walking); and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;social support and community (love and intimacy).<br><p>In short&#x2014;eat well, move more, stress less, and love more.</p><p>Many people tend to think of advances in medicine as high-tech and expensive, such as a new drug, laser, or surgical procedure. We often have a hard time believing that something as simple as comprehensive lifestyle changes can make such a powerful difference in our lives&#x2014;but they often do.</p><p>In our research, we&#x2019;ve used high-tech, expensive, state-of-the-art scientific measures to prove the power of these simple, low-tech, and low-cost interventions. These randomized controlled trials and other studies have been published in the leading peer-reviewed medical and scientific journals.</p><p>In addition to <i>preventing</i> many chronic diseases, these comprehensive lifestyle changes can often <i>reverse</i> the progression of these illnesses.</p><p>We proved, for the first time, that lifestyle changes alone can reverse the progression of even severe coronary heart disease. There was even more reversal after five years than after one year and 2.5 times fewer cardiac events. We also found that these lifestyle changes can reverse type 2 diabetes and may slow, stop, or even reverse the progression of early-stage prostate cancer.</p><p>Changing lifestyle actually changes your genes&#x2014;turning on genes that keep you healthy, and turning off genes that promote heart disease, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and diabetes&#x2014;more than five hundred genes in only three months. People often say, &#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s all in my genes. There&#x2019;s not much I can do about it.&#x201d; But there is. Knowing that changing lifestyle changes our genes is often very motivating&#x2014;not to blame, but to empower. Our genes are a predisposition, but our genes are not our fate.</p><p>Our latest research found that these diet and lifestyle changes may even lengthen telomeres, the ends of your chromosomes that control aging. As your telomeres get longer, your life gets longer. This was the first controlled study showing that any intervention may begin to reverse aging on a cellular level by lengthening telomeres. And the more people adhered to these lifestyle recommendations, the longer their telomeres became.</p><p>This is a different approach to personalized medicine. It&#x2019;s not like there was one set of dietary recommendations for reversing heart disease, a different one for reversing diabetes, and yet another for changing your genes or lengthening your telomeres. In all of our studies, people were asked to consume a whole-foods, plant-based diet like the one described in this book. It&#x2019;s as though your body knows how to personalize the medicine it needs if you give it the right raw materials in your diet and lifestyle.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not all or nothing. In all of our studies, we found that the more people changed their diets and lifestyles, the more they improved and the better they felt&#x2014;at any age. If you indulge yourself one day, eat healthier the next.</p><p>These lifestyle changes are part of the most influential trend in medicine today&#x2014;what is known as &#x201c;Lifestyle Medicine,&#x201d; which is lifestyle as <i>treatment</i> as well as prevention.</p><p>And what&#x2019;s good for you is good for our planet. To the degree we transition toward a whole-foods, plant-based diet, it not only makes a difference in our own lives; it also makes a difference in the lives of many others across the globe.</p><p>The crises in global warming, health-care costs, and energy resources can feel overwhelming: &#x201c;What can I do as one person to make a difference?&#x201d; This may lead to inaction, depression, and even nihilism.</p><p>However, when we realize that something as primal as what we choose to put in our mouths each day makes a difference in all three of these crises, it empowers us and imbues these choices with meaning. If it&#x2019;s meaningful, then it&#x2019;s sustainable&#x2014;and <i>a meaningful life is a longer life</i>.</p><p><b>HEALTH CRISIS</b></p><p>More than 75 percent of the $2.8 trillion in annual U.S. health-care costs (mostly sick-care costs) are from chronic diseases that can often be prevented and even reversed by eating a plant-based diet at a fraction of the costs.</p><p>For example, in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, patients who adhered to healthy dietary principles (low meat consumption and high intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain bread), never smoked, were not overweight, and had at least thirty minutes a day of physical activity had a 78 percent lower overall risk of developing a chronic disease. This included a 93 percent reduced risk of diabetes, an 81 percent lower risk of heart attacks, a 50 percent reduction in risk of stroke, and a 36 percent overall reduction in risk of cancer, compared with participants without these healthy factors.</p><p>Another recent study of more than twenty thousand men found that those who didn&#x2019;t have much belly fat and who had a healthy diet, didn&#x2019;t smoke, and exercised moderately reduced their risk of a heart attack by 80 percent.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not just low-fat versus low-carb. A new study found that animal protein dramatically increases the risk of premature death independent of fat and carbs. In a study of more than six thousand people, those aged fifty to sixty-five who reported eating diets high in animal protein had a 75 percent increase in overall mortality, a 400 percent increase in cancer deaths, and a 500 percent increase in type 2 diabetes during the following eighteen years.</p><p>At the same time that the power of comprehensive lifestyle changes is becoming more well documented, the limitations of high-tech medicine are becoming clearer.</p><p>For example, randomized controlled trials have shown that angioplasties, stents, and coronary bypass surgery do not prolong life or prevent heart attacks in most stable patients. Only one out of forty-nine people with early-stage prostate cancer and PSA levels below ten may benefit from surgery or radiation. Also, type 2 diabetes and prediabetes are pandemic, affecting almost one half of Americans, yet drug treatments to lower blood sugar do not prevent the complications of diabetes nearly as well as lowering blood sugar with diet and lifestyle. United Health Care estimated that if current trends continue, the costs of type 2 diabetes will be $3.3 <i>trillion</i> by 2020, which is clearly not sustainable.</p><p>Lifestyle medicine is cost effective as well as medically effective. Our research has shown that when comprehensive lifestyle changes are offered as <i>treatment</i> (not just as prevention), significant cost savings occur in the first year because the biological mechanisms that control our health and well-being are so dynamic.</p><p>For example, Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield found that overall health-care costs were reduced by 50 percent in the first year when people with heart disease or risk factors went through our lifestyle program in twenty-four hospitals and clinics in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Nebraska. In patients who spent more than $25,000 on health care in the prior year, costs were reduced 400 percent in the following year. In another study, Mutual of Omaha found that they saved $30,000 per patient in the first year in those who went through our lifestyle program.</p><p>Because of these findings, we are grateful that Medicare began covering our program of lifestyle medicine in 2010. If it&#x2019;s reimbursable, it&#x2019;s sustainable.

The livestock sector generates more greenhouse gas emissions than the entire global transportation chain as measured in carbon dioxide equivalent (18 percent versus 13.5 percent). More recent estimates are that these numbers are even higher&#x2014;that livestock and their by-products may actually account for more than 50 percent of annual worldwide greenhouse-gas emissions (at least 32.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year).</p><p>It is also responsible for 37 percent of all the human-induced methane, which is twenty-three times more toxic to the ozone layer than carbon dioxide, as well as generating 65 percent of the human-related nitrous oxide, which has 296 times the global-warming potential of carbon dioxide. Nitrous oxide and methane mostly come from manure, and fifty-six billion &#x201c;food animals&#x201d; produce a lot of manure each day.</p><p>Also, livestock now use 30 percent of the earth&#x2019;s entire land surface, mostly for permanent pasture but also including 33 percent of global arable land to produce feed for them. As forests are cleared to create new pastures for livestock, it is a major driver of deforestation: some 70 percent of forests in the Amazon have been turned over to grazing.</p><p><b>ENERGY CRISIS</b></p><p>More than half of U.S. grain and nearly 40 percent of world grain is being fed to livestock rather than being consumed directly by humans. In the United States, more than eight billion livestock are maintained; these livestock eat about seven times as much grain as is consumed directly by the entire U.S. population.</p><p>Producing one kg of fresh beef requires about thirteen kg of grain and thirty kg of forage. This much grain and forage requires a total of 43,000 liters of water.</p><p>So, to the degree we choose to eat a plant-based diet, we free up tremendous amounts of resources that can benefit many others as well as ourselves. I find this very meaningful. And when we can act more compassionately, it helps our hearts as well.</p><p>We&#x2019;re always making choices in our lives.

You could never be a nuisance.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> One of Susanna&#x2019;s friends, an older Quaker widow who held the beribbonned wassail bowl, knocked on the farmhouse door, while the others in the wassailing group formed a semicircle for the singing. A mangy mutt had announced their presence with deepthroated barking that echoed in the crisp cloudlessness of the coming night.&nbsp;<br><br> The fading golden brocade that streaked the sky overhead was all that remained of the daylight but enough to show the frozen rosy splotches on each of their noses and cheeks. Enough for Polly to glimpse tension on the face of the older Quaker widow.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;This is the last house,&#x201d; Polly whispered to Susanna, flexing her aching fingers inside her wool mittens. &#x201c;Then we shall return home.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Susanna conceded as the door opened and bright light poured out upon them, illuminating a spark in Susanna&#x2019;s eyes, a spark Polly knew all too well. A spark that meant something was afoot.&nbsp;<br><br> The Quaker widow stepped away from the door and took her place among other Dissenters in the group who were attired in plain and unadorned garments as was their custom. Earlier, after Susanna had convinced Polly to join her for the wassailing, Polly wasn&#x2019;t entirely surprised to discover that their company was made up of Susanna&#x2019;s Dissenter friends. Susanna made no pretense about her strong political views and never passed up an opportunity to gather with like-minded friends whenever she came to visit.<br><br> Although Polly would have preferred to wassail with friends from her own social circle, she hadn&#x2019;t been able to begrudge Susanna the favor. Nor had she been able to resist an opportunity to sing, even if the group was strange and sober.&nbsp;<br><br> Susanna&#x2019;s poke through her heavy cloak was Polly&#x2019;s sign to begin her song. As the open doorway filled with several women, Polly took her place at the fringe of the group and hummed several notes before starting, &#x201c;A jolly wassail bowl, a wassail of good ale . . .&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> The others allowed her to sing the first stanza by herself, and her voice lifted clear and pure with the melody of the traditional song. A hush fell over the women who were now stepping out of the farmhouse. As her song rose, even the dog stopped its barking.&nbsp;<br><br> At the Blue Anchor Inn across the road, she could feel the attention of several patrons upon her, men who were either coming to or going from the alehouse. Out of the corner of her eye, she could see that one stocky man had leaned his shoulder against the weathered clapboards and was staring at her from beneath the triangular brim of his cocked hat.&nbsp;<br><br> Susanna glanced toward the barn at the rear of the farmhouse and squeezed Polly&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Sing another verse.&#x201d; Susanna&#x2019;s request was met with a murmur of assent from the hefty woman facing them, likely the farmer&#x2019;s wife with her milkmaids and scullery girls behind her.&nbsp;<br><br> Polly didn&#x2019;t need much prodding to continue. Her song filled the air, drawing the plump, almost square-shaped farmer away from the barn toward them. With a limping gait, he lagged behind several boys, likely his sons. Polly was warmed with a small measure of satisfaction that her singing could please others so readily.&nbsp;<br><br> Later when she was alone, she would offer prayers of contrition for her vanity, but for now, she was helpless but to release the melody. She sang several more stanzas by herself as the crowd expanded the same way it had at their previous stops. Finally, Susanna and her friends joined in, finishing the song. Together they sang the chorus two more times before offering the wassail bowl to the farmer and then to his wife.&nbsp;<br><br> The drink was no longer bubbling hot as it had been at their first visit. Nevertheless, everyone sipped from the bowl and praised the sweet spiciness of fine ale and roasted crab apple blended with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger. In exchange for the songs and drink, the farmwife had her maids pass out an apple to each of the wassailers.&nbsp;<br><br> The chatter of the singers mingled with those of the farmer and his family, but the laughter this time was different, louder, more forced. Or maybe Polly was merely unnerved by the young man who continued to lean nonchalantly against the Blue Anchor and stare at her. The other patrons had listened for a verse or two before hustling on their way. But this one hadn&#x2019;t budged, not even when they&#x2019;d finished singing. The shadows of the early evening prevented her from seeing his features clearly, but from the glimpse or two she&#x2019;d caught, he was certainly dashing enough to make her squirm. <br><br> Polly focused her attention on Susanna, who was speaking to the farmer&#x2019;s wife. &#x201c;&#x2019;Tis true. We are ahead of the festivities for our wassailing as we&#x2019;ve not yet celebrated Twelfth Night. But we were in a joyous mood this day and thought to spread our cheer.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> The farmer&#x2019;s wife boxed one of the boys in his ear for drinking too long from the wassail bowl. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t complain that you&#x2019;ve come. Especially since your sister has such a pretty voice.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not&#x2014; &#x201d; Polly started to explain that Susanna was her aunt, her mother&#x2019;s youngest sister, but Susanna cut her off.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;I concur,&#x201d; Susanna said with a smile and toss of her dark ringlets from beneath her wide-brimmed straw hat. &#x201c;She does have a pretty voice.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Susanna was vivacious even in the fading daylight. Next to Susanna&#x2019;s ravishing beauty and charm, Polly often felt like a pale golden embroidery thread set against a dark lush tapestry. Although she&#x2019;d inherited her mother&#x2019;s fairness, there were times when Polly secretly lamented that her mother hadn&#x2019;t given her more of the French ancestral heritage, which had apparently been bequeathed upon Susanna to the fullest.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;If I were making the laws,&#x201d; Susanna continued, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d deem the entire month of December&#x2014; and not just twelve days&#x2014; be devoted to celebrating Christmas. But unfortunately, I&#x2019;m not part of the monarchy.&#x201d; Susanna peered around the farmyard and beyond to the stretch of road that led away from Chatham into the open countryside.&nbsp;<br><br> If Polly didn&#x2019;t know better, she&#x2019;d almost believe Susanna was looking for someone. Her Quaker friends, too, were glancing around more than usual. With the coming of night, perhaps they were merely nervous about the need to return to their homes. Nothing good ever happened after darkness, particularly near the River Medway where dangerous smugglers had become all too common in recent months.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Shall we be on our way?&#x201d; Polly leaned into Susanna as far as the fan hoops on her petticoat would allow. &#x201c;I vow, it&#x2019;s time to go before we&#x2019;re left to wander in total darkness.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> Susanna lifted one inky brow at her widowed friend, who in turn gave a slight shake of her head as though to tell her &#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> The unspoken communication between the Quaker widow and Susanna only made Polly more wary. Something more than wassailing was happening tonight. Of that she was growing certain. Were Susanna and her friends arranging one of their protests tonight? During her last visit, Susanna had secretly participated in passing out pamphlets expressing disapproval of the slave trade and stressing the need for reforms. Polly hadn&#x2019;t known of the clandestine activities until she found a stack of pamphlets in Susanna&#x2019;s bag. When she confronted Susanna, her aunt swore her to silence.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Perhaps one more song from my dear sister Mary?&#x201d; Susanna asked, raising her voice along with Polly&#x2019;s mittened hand. Susanna&#x2019;s slanted glance told Polly not to question her pretense over being sisters or the use of her given name, Mary, rather than her nickname. Susanna&#x2019;s squeeze told her to just sing. At the ensuing enthusiasm from the farmer and his household, Polly had no choice but to indulge them in spite of her unease.&nbsp;<br><br> Once the last notes of melody drifted away, she was relieved when the members of their wassailing group tightened their cloaks and with brief good-byes started down the lane toward Rochester where many of the Quakers lived.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Needn&#x2019;t we go the other way?&#x201d; Polly asked, increasing her stride to keep up with Susanna&#x2019;s lengthy one. She caught the edge of her flat straw hat to keep it from blowing off her head. Underneath she wore a bonnet-like cap edged in lace, which although stylish did little to keep her ears warm.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;We shall accompany our friends a short distance before turning around,&#x201d; Susanna said tersely, with a sharp look over her shoulder toward the farmhouse. They were already on the outskirts of Chatham on the highroad that would eventually wind its way through Rochester and north to London. The road ran close to the bank of the River Medway, and the dampness from the river and the nearby North Sea made the December air especially biting.&nbsp;<br><br> As they walked Polly&#x2019;s breath came in cloudy bursts that disappeared into the lengthening twilight shadows. No one spoke, and in the complete silence, their footsteps against the hard-packed, frozen dirt sounded choppy and hurried.&nbsp;<br><br> If she didn&#x2019;t know better, she&#x2019;d suspect they were running away from someone. &#x201c;Why are we so somber&#x2014; &#x201d; Polly started, but Susanna cut her off with a harsh shush.&nbsp;<br><br> When they came to a fork in the road, Susanna peered over her shoulder again, her pretty features taut with anxiety. Woods hedged them in, preventing them from seeing the farmhouse and the inn. But sudden shouts from the area whence they&#x2019;d come drew alarm upon every face in their small group.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Hide!&#x201d; the Quaker widow hissed as she picked up her heavy skirts and broke into the hedgerow between the road and the river.&nbsp;<br><br> Susanna grabbed Polly&#x2019;s arm and dragged her the opposite direction down the road that led to the nearby hamlet of Luton. &#x201c;Quickly.&#x201d; Susanna pulled Polly along at a near run. Polly didn&#x2019;t resist as a sense of dread rapidly spread through her limbs, chasing away the frigidness that had gripped her.&nbsp;<br><br> Susanna had apparently gotten herself into trouble again. The question was, what kind and how much?&nbsp;<br><br> Polly raced after Susanna until her lungs felt seared with the effort. It wasn&#x2019;t long before the heavy clomp of horse hooves pounded the road behind them. Without slowing her pace, Susanna veered into the woods, and Polly had no choice but to follow. They stumbled over windfall and low branches, their crackling and crashing suggesting an advancing army rather than two delicate young ladies.<br><br> &#x201c;Halt.&#x201d; Susanna held out an arm, steadying Polly.<br><br> &#x201c;Susanna, why are we running? What have you done?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Not now. For mercy&#x2019;s sake, be silent and hide.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Susanna crouched behind an ash tree, but the hoops at her hips made concealment impossible behind the trunk. Polly slunk to a fuller hedge that was still covered with a smattering of dried leaves. Her hoops were cumbersome too, but she bent low nonetheless. Thankfully the falling darkness would veil them more than the woodland did.&nbsp;<br><br> The rapid thudding of her heart and her labored breaths momentarily drowned out the approaching horse. As the rider came nigh and slowed the horse&#x2019;s gait, Polly held herself motionless, praying the newcomer would pass by.&nbsp;<br><br> When the rider reined his horse on the road in front of them, she sucked in a breath at the same time as Susanna. For a long moment, he sat silently atop the beast and surveyed the woodland on either side. When he seemed to turn and look directly at Polly, she stiffened. She didn&#x2019;t know if he could see her through the thick growth and darkness, but when he hopped down from his saddle, her body tensed. He began to move to the edge of the woods. She ducked her head and glanced at Susanna for some indication of what to do. Should they attempt to run, perhaps deeper into the woods?&nbsp;<br><br> Susanna merely put a finger to her lips and gave her head an imperceptible shake.&nbsp;<br> He stopped at the side of the road and tipped up the pointed brim of his hat revealing his face. Polly sucked in another breath. His features weren&#x2019;t clear in the deepening shadows, but she could see enough of his strong jaw and broad shoulders to recognize him. It was the young man who&#x2019;d leaned against the Blue Anchor Inn and watched her sing.&nbsp;<br><br> At the thundering of more horse hooves, the man pivoted away and bounded to the other side of the road. His easy swagger and hair tied back in a queue identified him as a sailor. He fumbled at the clasp of his trousers, and within seconds Polly thought she heard a distinct splatter of rain against dry leaves. Only it wasn&#x2019;t rain . . .&nbsp;<br><br> Was the man relieving himself?&nbsp;<br><br> Polly had to cup her hand over her mouth to catch her surprise. With the approach of darkness, the moon had made its appearance and illuminated him, but thankfully his horse sidled middle of the road, shielding her from the display. Nevertheless, she was mortified.&nbsp;<br><br> To make matters worse, the man began to whistle a ribald folk song. Seemingly without a care in the world, he whistled the merry tune, even as two men on horseback came upon him and reined abruptly, causing his horse to shy sideways and nicker.&nbsp;<br><br> The sailor glanced over his shoulder at the newcomers. His whistle tapered off as did the other sound. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re thinking of robbing me,&#x201d; he said in a slurred voice, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re in for a sore disappointment. I gambled away my last halfpence at the inn.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care the devil about robbing you.&#x201d; Polly recognized the square face of the farmer at the home where they&#x2019;d just been wassailing.&nbsp;<br><br> The sailor gave an unsteady laugh. &#x201c;Good that, since all I have to give you is the shirt off my back.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> The farmer and his companion didn&#x2019;t laugh. Instead, they surveyed the woods. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re looking for a group of women that came a-wassailing by the farm.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Again the sailor laughed and lurched toward his horse, grappling for the reins but missing and nearly falling to the ground. &#x201c;If you find them, let me know; I&#x2019;ll join you in the fun.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Polly&#x2019;s muscles turned rigid at his implication.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Then you haven&#x2019;t seen any women?&#x201d; the farmer demanded, examining the road that led to Luton.&nbsp;<br><br> Polly wasn&#x2019;t sure if the sailor had seen them, but she readied herself to bolt should he divulge their location.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Women? I sure wish I had seen some,&#x201d; the sailor said finally, maintaining a grip on the reins of his horse. &#x201c;But alas, if my game of hijinks is any indication, then this looks to be my unlucky night.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Polly didn&#x2019;t know much about alehouse games, but she&#x2019;d heard enough criticism of the dice and drinking game to know it was one of the bawdiest.&nbsp;<br><br> The farmer spoke to his companion in lo...</p><h2>Three Classic Children&#39;s Stories: Little Red Riding Hood, Jack the Giant-Killer, and Rumpelstiltskin</h2><p><p>Three timeless favorites&#x2014;Little Red Riding Hood, Jack the Giant-Killer, and Rumpelstiltskin&#x2014;come together in this enchanting collection of read-aloud fun.

And the fires of a fierce and passionate affair may not have burned out completely -- on Brodie's part at least, since he's prepared to destroy Hazel's marriage to win back his "Juliet." But when a sudden, brutal murder unleashes a slew of sinister secrets and long-seething hatreds, putting Hazel's life in peril, Gemma knows she will need help unraveling this very bloody knot -- and calls for the one man she trusts more than any other, Duncan Kincaid, to join her far from home ... and in harm's way.</p></p><p><p>Deborah Crombie is a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author and a native Texan who has lived in both England and Scotland.

This time, Duncan and Gemma take a busman's holiday when the host of Gemma's bed-and-breakfast in Glenlivet Valley, Scotland, is murdered. Old romances and festering resentments, both historic and current, provide the context for an entertaining whodunit. In addition to accents, Deehy manages to make clear the frequent shifts in time and place without disturbing the flow of the engaging narration.

But who really were the Beatles, and how did they and everything else in the 1960s fuse so explosively?</p><p>Mark Lewisohn's three-part biography is the first true and accurate account of the Beatles, a contextual history built upon impeccable research and written with energy, style, objectivity and insight. This first volume covers the crucial and less-known early period - the Liverpool and Hamburg years of a hungry rock and roll band, when all the sharp characters and situations take shape.</p><p>This is the Beatles like you've never read them before. It isn't just 'another book', it's the book, from the world-acknowledged authority. Forget what you know and discover the complete story.</p></p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Mark Lewisohn</b></p> <p><strong>Q. So much has been written about the Beatles, why is this book different to all other books?</strong></p> <p>A. 'We know everything there is to know about the Beatles, so what else can possibly be written?' People say that all the time &#x2013; and I don't agree with it for a second. I wouldn't argue the Beatles' story has been told often, but I <em>would</em> argue that it can't be told again and differently. It's been related the same old way for so very long and it's also dying under the suffocating blanket of 'celebrity'. I want to start again, I want to press the Refresh button.</p> <p>This is a comprehensive biography, three volumes, a sequential history in which I set out to relate everything that happened, and do so with integrity, attention to detail, accuracy and, I believe, a fair understanding of where the story needs to be told and how to tell it. I'm writing so it unfolds as if in real time &#x2013; there's no hindsight cleverness, so you get a vivid sense of the forward movement. The Beatles' story always had tremendous energy, speed, vitality &#x2013; and this must be tangible to the reader.</p> <p>It all boils down to this. They were four war babies from Liverpool who really did change the world, and whose music and impact still lives on in so many ways, after all these years. I say, let's scrub what we know, or think we know, and start over: <em>Who really were these people, and how did it all happen? </em></p> <p><strong>Q. What period of the story does <em>Tune In</em> cover?</strong></p> <p>A. It ends on 31 December 1962, with the Beatles on the cusp of their phenomenal breakthrough, but with everything having fallen well into place &#x2013; all the people, places, personalities, situations, organisation. So I'm writing about the Liverpool and Hamburg years, the formative years, the teenage years and the childhood years, and all the family backgrounds in a <em>Who Do They Think They Are?</em>-style history &#x2013; and these families were almost as fascinating as their famous offspring. The three volumes aren't only about 'who these people were' but 'what made them what they were?' I begin this history in 1845; there's a fair deal of Irish blood in the Beatles and I start with the potato famine, which forces the Lennons into Liverpool. Then it moves swiftish through the next hundred years and becomes very solid from the Second World War and the arrival of all the main players.</p> <p>I'm sure it won't surprise anyone to learn that the Beatles didn't suddenly grow personalities when they had a hit record &#x2013; that their talent, originality and relentless desire to move on fast, to try new things, was already well in place in their early years. I'm sure no one would be amazed to find the Beatles didn't become instantly remarkable when they conquered Britain, America and much of the world, or funny when they filmed <em>A Hard Day's Night</em>, or inventive when recording <em>Revolver</em> or <em>Sgt Pepper</em>. It was always who they were, a continuation of what was going in all these earlier years, except more visible. The richness of the stories to come in books two and three is also in volume one all the way through. Really, everything was revved up and running in these formative years, in the halls, houses and streets of Liverpool, the only place these people and those events could have happened.</p> <p><strong>Q. You have a long professional association with the Beatles, and some of them individually. Are they involved in <em>Tune In</em> and is this book authorized?</strong></p> <p>A. No. I received the odd tiny bit of help which I specifically asked for and they didn't have to give &#x2013; but substantially no, they're not involved. That's fine, because it's what I expected and what I wanted. This has to be an independent and impartial book. But are the all main players appearing and speaking at the book's core? Yes, constantly. Paul McCartney decided not to talk to me for this particular project, and I completely respect and understand his reasons &#x2013; but I've interviewed him maybe fifteen times in the past and I've also sourced other quotes of great strength and immediacy for all the players.</p> <p>One of many reasons the Beatles' achievements and reputation sustain with such integrity is because they were true. They stood for truth, projected truth and lived truthfully as best they could. It's entirely right that their history is written as true as possible, with no embroidery, nothing faked or glossed, nothing stupidly interpreted, everything transparent, everything attributed. Of course my attachment to this subject is deep and lifelong, but I'm not the least bit interested in writing a book simply to say how great they were. They certainly don't need that, and I certainly wouldn't do it. It'd be a waste of my time. My passion is for learning everything I can about this subject, understanding it, and doing my best to set it down clearly so it can be understood relative to what happened.</p>Mark Lewisohn is universally acknowledged as the world&#39;s expert on The Beatles. He is the author of six previous Beatles books and has been described by the Independent as the band&#39;s &#39;Emeritus Professor&#39;.</p><h2>Maigret Goes to School (Inspector Maigret)</h2><p><b><b><b><b>&#x201c;One of the greatest writers of the twentieth century . . .

With limb-like protuberances culminating in fins the strange fish was unlike anything she had ever seen. The museum board members dismissed it as a common lungfish, but when Marjorie eventually contacted Professor JLB Smith, he immediately identified her fish as a coelacanth &#x2013; a species known to have lived 400 million years ago, and believed by many scientists to be the evolutionary missing link &#x2013; the first creature to crawl out of the sea. Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer had thus made the century&#x2019;s greatest zoological discovery. But Smith needed a live or frozen specimen to verify the discovery, so began his search for another coelacanth, to which he devoted his life.</p></p><p>In 1938, an alert young South African museum curator named Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer came upon a curious specimen in a fisherman's nets: a fish with "four limb-like fins and a strange little puppy dog tail," one that she thought resembled not a living being so much as a china ornament. When she could turn up no written descriptions of the find, she turned to other scientists for help, touching off a worldwide wave of interest in the creature that would come to be called the "coelacanth," long thought to be extinct, and now celebrated as one of the world's oldest species.<p> That interest took many forms, writes journalist Samantha Weinberg in her entertaining and instructive case study in scientific detective work. It spurred the development of new deep-sea craft to explore the farthest reaches of the ocean; it touched off more than one controversy over the coelacanth's lineage, and even over which nation claimed sovereignty over its oceanic haunts; and it launched or advanced the careers of dozens of researchers. The coelacanth continues to make news. In 1998, a young American scholar found a specimen in Indonesia, far from the western Indian Ocean waters where the coelacanth was thought to dwell. Although some scientists decried the discovery as a hoax at worst and an aberration at best, the find showed that the creature's range was widespread. It demonstrated, too, that international cooperation was necessary if the coelacanth were to be protected in the future, "continuing to exist," as Weinberg writes, "after this extraordinary duration of time." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><p>Samantha Weinberg, 31, is a writer and journalist of South African extraction who was born and brought up in London.

The Great War is grinding on, chewing up young men by the thousands. Initially, in the loyal Dominion of Canada, people are mostly eager to support the Motherland and fight for the Empire. Men perceived as slackers or cowards are shunned. But the carnage is horrendous and with enforced conscription, the enthusiasm for war is dimming. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William Murdoch is a widower, a senior detective who, thanks to the new temperance laws, spends his time tracking down bootleggers and tipplers; most unsatisfying. His wife, Amy, died giving birth to their second child, a girl who lived only a few hours more. Murdoch, racked by grief, withdrew from four-year-old, Jack. This he regrets and would dearly love to make up for his negligence. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we enter the story, Jack, now twenty-one, has returned from France after being wounded and gassed at the Battle of Passchendaele. It is soon apparent that he is deeply troubled but he's not confiding in his father. He does, however, seem to be bound by shared secrets to another wounded former soldier, Percy McKinnon. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Murdoch suddenly has much more serious crimes than rum-running on his hands. The night after Jack and McKinnon arrive home, a young man is found stabbed to death in the impoverished area of Toronto known as the Ward. Soon after, Murdoch has to deal with a tragic suicide, also a young man. Two more murders follow in quick succession. The only common denominator is that all of the men were exempted from conscription. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increasingly worried that Jack knows more than he is letting on, Murdoch must solve these crimes before more innocents lose their lives. It is a solution that will give him only sorrow.</p><p>Born in England, MAUREEN JENNINGS emigrated to Canada as a teenager. The first Detective Murdoch Mystery was published in 1997. Six more followed, all to enthusiastic reviews. In 2003, Shaftesbury Films adapted three of the novels into movies of the week, and four years later the <i>Murdoch Mysteries</i> TV series was created; it is now shown around the world, including in the UK, the United States (as <i>The Artful Detective</i>), and much of Europe, as well as on Canada's national broadcast network, CBC TV. The Detective Inspector Tom Tyler series, set in World War II-era England, got off to a spectacular start with 2011's <i>Season of Darkness</i>, followed by <i>Beware This Boy</i> (2012)<i>, No Known Grave</i> (2014), and <i>Dead Ground in Between</i> (2016).

Within them they found the beginning threads from which to weave a theology of creation, fall and redemption. Following their mentor, the apostle Paul, they explored the profound significance of Adam as a type of Christ, the second Adam. The six days of creation proved especially attractive among the fathers as a subject for commentary, with Basil the Great and Ambrose producing well-known <em>Hexaemerons.</em> Similarly, Augustine devoted portions of five works to the first chapter of Genesis. As in previous volumes within the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, the range of comment contained in <em>Genesis 1--11</em> spans from the first century to the eighth, from East to West, and from Greek and Latin speakers to Syriac. Especially helpful in this volume is editor Andrew Louth's supply of Septuagintal alternative readings to the Masoretic text, which are often necessary to understanding the fathers' flow of thought. <em>Genesis 1--11</em> opens up a treasure house of ancient wisdom--allowing these faithful witnesses, some appearing here in English translation for the first time, to speak with eloquence and intellectual acumen to the church today.</p><p>Andrew Louth is professor emeritus of patristic and Byzantine studies at Durham University, England, and visiting professor of Eastern Orthodox theology at the Amsterdam Centre of Eastern Orthodox Theology (ACEOT), in the Faculty of Theology, the Free University, Amsterdam. He is also a priest of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Sourozh (Moscow Patriarchate), serving the parish in Durham. His recent publications include <em>Introducing Eastern Orthodox Theology</em>, <em>Greek East and Latin West, AD 681-1071</em>, <em>Maximus the Confessor</em> and <em>The Origins of the Christian Mystical Tradition</em>."This volume continues the valuable exploration of patristic interpretation."

Metzger, professor emeritus of New Testament, Princeton Theological Seminary)<br><br>"For those who think that church history began around 1941, when their pastor was born, this commentary will be a great surprise. Christians throughout the centuries have read the biblical text and nursed their spirits with it and then applied it to their lives. These commentaries reflect that the witness of the Holy Spirit was present in his church throughout the centuries. As a result, we can profit by allowing the ancient Christians to speak to us today." (Haddon Robinson, Harold John Ockenga Distinguished Professor of Preaching, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary)<br><br>"There is no shortage of new books on the market and it may be a surprise to some to see IVP producing the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture series. But, bearing in mind C. S. Lewis's admonition, 'It is a good rule, after reading a new book, never to allow yourself another new one till you have read an old one in between,' this series will fill a great need that many of us may not even be aware of--the need to read those who have gone before us." (D. Stuart Briscoe)<br><br>"We speak abstractly in scholarly circles of the need to transcend looking at Christianity through the spectrum of modern presuppositions. This series, based on the commentaries of early Christians, gives us a concrete way to do this. It's a great idea." (Don S. Browning, Alexander Campbell Professor of Ethics and Social Sciences, The Divinity School, University of Chicago)<br><br>"The Scriptures have been read with love and attention for nearly two thousand years, and listening to the voice of believers from previous centuries opens us to unexpected insight and deepened faith. Those who studied Scripture in the centuries closest to its writing, the centuries during and following persecution and martyrdom, speak with particular authority. The Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture will bring to life the truth that we are invisibly surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses." (Frederica Mathewes-Green, commentator, National Public Radio)<br><br>"Composed in the style of the great medieval <em>catenae,</em> this new anthology of patristic commentary on Holy Scripture, conveniently arranged by chapter and verse, will be a valuable resource for prayer, study and proclamation. By calling attention to the rich Christian heritage preceding the separations between East and West and between Protestant and Catholic, this series will perform a major service to the cause of ecumenism."

Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique was nearly destroyed in a brutal civil war, then was reborn and is now evolv-ing back to its original state. Edward O. Wilson&#x2019;s personal, luminous description of the wonders of Gorongosa is beautifully complemented by Piotr Naskrecki&#x2019;s extraordinary photographs of the park&#x2019;s exquisite natural beauty. A bonus DVD of Academy Award&#x2013;winning director Jessica Yu&#x2019;s documentary, <i>The Guide</i>, is also included with the book. <br> <br>Wilson takes readers to the summit of Mount Gorongosa, sacred to the local people and the park&#x2019;s vital watershed. From the forests of the mountain he brings us to the deep gorges on the edge of the Rift Valley, previously unexplored by biologists, to search for new species and assess their ancient origins. He describes amazing animal encounters from huge colonies of agricultural termites to spe�cialized raider ants that feed on them to giant spi�ders, a battle between an eagle and a black mamba, &#x201c;conversations&#x201d; with traumatized elephants that survived the slaughter of the park&#x2019;s large animals, and more. He pleads for Gorongosa&#x2014;and other wild places&#x2014;to be allowed to exist and evolve in its time�less way uninterrupted into the future. <br> <br>As he examines the near destruction and rebirth of Gorongosa, Wilson analyzes the balance of nature, which, he observes, teeters on a razor&#x2019;s edge. Loss of even a single species can have serious ramifications throughout an ecosystem, and yet we are carelessly destroying complex biodiverse ecosystems with unknown consequences. The wildlands in which these ecosystems flourish gave birth to humanity, and it is this natural world, still evolving, that may outlast us and become our leg�acy, our window on eternity.</p><p>Edward O. Wilson is generally recognized as one of the world&#x2019;s leading scientists. He is a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and the author of many influential books, including <i>The Diversity of Life</i>, <i>Naturalist</i>, <i>The Ants</i>, and <i>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis</i>. He is currently Honorary Curator in Entomology and University Research Professor Emeritus, Harvard University.&#x201c;<i>A Window on Eternity </i>revels in biodiversity and nature&#x2019;s inventiveness. . . .

Wilson is back with a new book that explores a slice of wilderness in deepest Africa. . . . As usual, Wilson&#x2019;s observations carry more weight than the descriptions of a simple naturalist. In <i>A Window on Eternity</i>, he invites us to glimpse ourselves in the mirror of one of Earth&#x2019;s few remaining wildernesses.&#x201d; Author: Bob Grant Source: The Scientist<br><br>"[Wilson is] The world's greatest living naturalist." Author: Justin Moyer Source: The Washington Post<br><br>&#x201c;Wilson describes in language that is both poetic and scientific a kind of parable of what is possible in the realm of environmental protection. . . . By destroying the natural world, we are destroying ourselves. Our blindness to this reality is the most crucial and fundamental fact of the world today. <i>A Window on Eternity</i> brings this reality into focus in a lucid and disarmingly gentle manner.

With the recent publication of A Manual for Cleaning Women, and the sustained critical acclaim it has received, Berlin has finally been recognized as a master of the short story, allowing her work to reach the broad audience it deserves. These two collections capture distilled moments of crisis or epiphany, placing the protagonists in moments of stress or personal strain, and all told in an almost offhand, matter of fact voice. Weaving through the places she loved Chile, Mexico, the Southwest, and California each story delivers a poignant moment that lingers in the mind, not resolved, not decoded, but resonating, as questions of the human condition always do, in the heart of the reader.</p><p>Affecting . . . Compelling . . . Remarkably successful. Berlin places her memorable characters in gripping situations, plumbing their messed-up lives for pathos and allowing us to see deeply into their souls. --Publishers Weekly<br><br>Most of the twenty-three stories in this collection are very short and very simple. They are set in the places Berlin knows best: Chile, Mexico, the Desert Southwest, and California, and they have the casual, straightforward, immediate, and intimate style that distinguishes her work. They are told in a conversational voice and they move with a swift and often lyrical economy. They capture and communicate moments of grace and cast a lovely, lazy light that lasts. Berlin is one of our finest writers and here she is at the height of her powers. --Molly Giles, San Francisco Chronicle</p><h2>The Great Inversion and the Future of the American City</h2><p><p>Eye-opening and thoroughly engaging, this is an indispensible look at American urban/suburban society and its future.<br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>The Great Inversion, </i>Alan Ehrenhalt, one of our leading urbanologists, reveals how the roles of America&#x2019;s cities and suburbs are changing places&#x2014;young adults and affluent retirees moving in, while immigrants and the less affluent are moving out&#x2014;and addresses the implications of these shifts for the future of our society.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ehrenhalt shows us how the commercial canyons of lower Manhattan are becoming residential neighborhoods, and how mass transit has revitalized inner-city communities in Chicago and Brooklyn. He explains why car-dominated cities like Phoenix and Charlotte have sought to build twenty-first-century downtowns from scratch, while sprawling postwar suburbs are seeking to attract young people with their own form of urbanized experience.</p></p><p><p>Alan Ehrenhalt was the executive editor of <i>Governing</i> magazine from 1990 to 2009. He is the author of <i>The United States of Ambition</i>, <i>The Lost City</i>, and <i>Democracy in the Mirror</i>.

He lives near Washington, D.C.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Great Inversion</i> is a must read for anyone concerned with American cities, urbanism, and the future of the way we live. . . . The future of the city is the future of America and the world. Alan Ehrenhalt shows us how a desire for urbanism is bringing people back to America&#x2019;s downtowns, and what suburbs and communities of all sorts must do to thrive in the future.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;Richard Florida, author of <i>Who&#x2019;s Your City?</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;[Ehrenhalt&#x2019;s] provocative, nuanced examination of the dynamics of change encourages the reader to apply his insights to cities closer to home. . . . Alan Ehrenhalt&#x2019;s fascinating new book, <i>The Great Inversion</i> . . . finds that American cities are doing a very un-American thing: reshaping themselves in the mold of European capitals, where the privileged live in the city center, orbited by rings of immigrants and other strivers in the poorer suburbs&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>Commentary</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Fascinating. . . . A convincing case. . . . Mr. Ehrenhalt&#x2019;s travels have given him a front-row view of &#x2018;The Great Inversion.&#x2019; . . .

Solidly researched with great questions asked and plenty of hard facts and anecdotal answers provided.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>Christian Science Monitor</i><br><br>&#x201c;Books about cities tend to be polemics. An author decides what&#x2019;s right and wrong about how we live, then marshals anecdotes and rhetoric to buttress the case. There&#x2019;s another way to approach the topic: in person and on foot, following one&#x2019;s instincts but open to nuance along the way. Alan Ehrenhalt follows that path, to our benefit, in his new book <i>The Great Inversion and the Future of the American City</i>. . . . Ehrenhalt&#x2019;s sympathies are with movements like new urbanism and smart growth, but these sympathies don&#x2019;t blur his sharp eye for details or the wry clarity of his&nbsp;prose.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> <br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Great Inversion</i> and the United Nations agree; the world is becoming more urban by the day . . . To Ehrenhalt&#x2019;s credit, he does not pass moral judgment on the process. With clear prose that is both informative and entertaining, he objectively states the facts (and presents a great number of voices from immigrant businessmen and local civil servants to politicians from Elite African-American families and developers), leaving his readers free to render their own verdict.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;Joshua Bloodworth, Dominion of New York<br><br>&#x201c;Most writers on cities are either cheerleaders or naysayers.

She could not<br>see Jamie McKie&#x2019;s face at that late hour. Only his sleek brown hair,<br>tied at the nape of his neck, and his favorite blue waistcoat, crumpled<br>from a long day of waiting for his son to be born.

And <i>frichtsome. </i>The words clapped like thunder: &#x2018;Behold, I am with you wherever you go. I will never leave you.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Leana gasped. &#x201c;But, Jamie&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye, lass. The same words you whispered to me on our wedding<br>night.&#x201d;<br><i><br>Nae! </i>Rose pressed her hands to her ears at the very moment a sharp<br>knock sounded at the door. Startled, she fell forward with a soft cry, her<br>hiding place forgotten.<br><br>Leana&#x2019;s voice floated across the room. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there, behind the<br>chair?&#x201d;<br><br>Rose drew back, her heart pounding beneath her stays. But it was<br>too late. Taking a long, slow breath, she stood to her feet and did her<br>best to look penitent.<br><br>The peat fire lit Jamie&#x2019;s astonished face. &#x201c;Rose?&#x201d;<br><br>Shame burned her cheeks. Before she could find words to explain<br>herself, the door creaked open, and the coppery head of their housekeeper,<br>Neda Hastings, appeared.<br><br>&#x201c;Leana, I&#x2019;ve come <i>tae </i>see ye get some rest...&#x201d; Neda&#x2019;s words faded as<br>she caught sight of Rose. &#x201c;There ye are, lass! I <i>thocht </i>ye&#x2019;d wandered off<br>tae the kitchen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nae.&#x201d; She could not look at Jamie. &#x201c;I...I wanted to see...the baby.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Come, dearie,&#x201d; Leana murmured, stretching out her hand. &#x201c;You<br>had only to ask.&#x201d;<br><br>Gathering her skirts and her courage about her, Rose crossed the<br>wooden floor to Leana&#x2019;s bedside, barely noticing the others as her gaze<br>fell on the tiny bundle in Leana&#x2019;s arms. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t he a dear thing?&#x201d; While<br>Leana held back the linen blanket, Rose smoothed her hand across Ian&#x2019;s<br>downy hair, as rich a brown as Jamie&#x2019;s own. &#x201c; &#x2019;Tis so soft,&#x201d; she whispered.<br>Had she ever touched anything more precious? His little head fit<br>perfectly within the cup of her hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Would you like to hold him, Rose?&#x201d;<br><br>Her breath caught. &#x201c;Might I?&#x201d; She bent down, surprised to find her<br>arms were shaking. She&#x2019;d held babies before, but not this one. Not<br>Jamie&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Ohh,&#x201d; she said when Leana placed the babe in the crook of her<br>arm. &#x201c;How warm he is!&#x201d;<br><br>Rose held Ian close and bent her head over his, breathing in the scent of his skin, marveling at how pink he was. And how small. Deep inside her a longing stirred to life, as if some unnamed desire had waited for this moment to arrive. All of her sixteen years Rose had feared motherhood; the miracle in her arms put such foolish concerns to rest. Her mother had died in childbirth, yet Leana had lived, and so had her babe. &#x201c;My own nephew,&#x201d; Rose said gently, stroking his cheek. &#x201c;Ian James McKie.&#x201d;<br><br>No wonder Jamie was enchanted. Leana was not the one who&#x2019;d<br>stolen Jamie&#x2019;s heart this night; it was Ian, his newborn son.<br><br>Neda came up behind her, resting her hands on Rose&#x2019;s shoulders,<br>peering round her to look at the babe. &#x201c;Ye&#x2019;ll make a fine <i>mither </i>someday.<br>Suppose ye <i>gie </i>Ian back tae yer sister afore he starts to <i>greet.</i>&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye.&#x201d; Rose did as she was told, chagrined at how cool and empty<br>her arms felt.<br><br>&#x201c;The <i>auld </i>wives say,&#x201d; Neda cooed, tucking Leana&#x2019;s bedcovers in<br>place, &#x201c;the child that&#x2019;s born on the Sabbath day is blithe and bonny and<br>good and gay. Isn&#x2019;t that so, Mr. McKie?&#x201d;<br><br>Jamie smiled down at his son. &#x201c;Ian is all those things.&#x201d;<br><br>When Jamie lifted his head, Rose looked into his eyes, hoping she<br>might find his love for her reflected there. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Jamie. For hiding<br>in the corner.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No harm was done, Rose.&#x201d; His steady gaze confused her. Was he<br>glad she was there? Or eager for her to leave?<br><br>Neda picked up the candle by the bed and waved it toward the<br>door. &#x201c;Go along, lass. And ye as well, Mr. McKie. Leana needs a bit<br><i>mair </i>care and a <i>guid </i>deal o&#x2019; sleep. We&#x2019;ll bring yer wife and babe <i>hame<br></i>tae Auchengray soon.&#x201d;<br><br>Rose took her leave, pretending not to notice as Jamie bent down<br>to kiss her sister&#x2019;s hand, then her brow, then her mouth, where he tarried<br>longer than duty required. <i>Oh, Jamie. </i>Had his affections shifted<br>so quickly? In a day? In an hour? Rose closed the door behind her,<br>shutting out the worst of it. Her empty stomach squeezed itself into a<br>hard knot, even as her chin began to wobble. She would not cry. She<br>would <i>not.<br></i><br>The hall was pitch-black, the last of the candles snuffed out by the<br>thrifty minister&#x2019;s wife, who&#x2019;d shooed her household off to bed an hour<br>ago. Rose halted, unsure of her way in the darkness. Was that her green<br>cloak hanging near the door or someone else&#x2019;s? She would need its thick<br>woolen folds for the journey home.<br><br>Behind her the spence door shut with a faint click of the latch.<br>&#x201c;Rose?&#x201d;<br><i><br>Jamie. </i>She could not bring herself to answer him, though she sensed<br>him closing the distance between them, his footsteps echoing in the<br>empty hall. His hand touched her waist. &#x201c;Rose, you must understand...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do understand.&#x201d; Her voice remained steady while the rest of her<br>trembled. &#x201c;Now that she has given you a healthy son, Leana is the one<br>you love.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nae, Rose.&#x201d; Jamie grasped her elbow and spun her about. The heat<br>of his fingers penetrated the fabric of her gown, and his eyes bored into<br>hers. &#x201c;To my shame, I do not love Leana. Not yet.&#x201d; He lowered his<br>voice, tightening his grip on her arm. &#x201c;But I will learn to love your sister.<br>By all that&#x2019;s holy, I must, Rose. She is my wife, the mother of my son,<br>and&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And she loves you.&#x201d;<br><br>He dared not disagree, for they both knew it was true. &#x201c;Aye, she<br>does.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, so do I.&#x201d; Swallowing her pride, Rose reached up to caress his<br>face, reveling at the rough feel of his unshaven skin. &#x201c;And you love me,<br>Jamie. You told me so again this morning, you said&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Things I should not have said on this or any other Sabbath.&#x201d; Jamie<br>turned away, releasing his hold on her. &#x201c;Something happened this day,<br>Rose.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye. Your son was born&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Before that, I mean. I had a discussion with Duncan.&#x201d; He hung<br>his head. &#x201c;More like a confession.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Duncan, you say?&#x201d; Neda&#x2019;s husband, the overseer of Auchengray,<br>was a good man and kind. But unbending when it came to certain<br>matters. &#x201c;Whatever did you confess to him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The truth.&#x201d; The relief on Jamie&#x2019;s face was visible even in the dim<br>entrance hall. &#x201c;I promised Duncan...nae, I promised God that I would<br>be a good husband to Leana and a good father to Ian. I must keep that<br>promise now. You ken I must.&#x201d; He stared down at the flagstone floor,<br>his voice strained. &#x201c;Let me go, Rose. Please.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let you <i>go?</i>&#x201d; Her throat tightened. &#x201c;But, Jamie, I love you. After<br>all we&#x2019;ve been through, how can you ask such a thing of me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because you love your sister.&#x201d;<br><br>She cringed at the reminder. &#x201c;Not as much as I love you.&#x201d;<br>Jamie looked up. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve loved her longer though. Every day of<br>your life.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not this day,&#x201d; Rose protested, though they both knew she didn&#x2019;t<br>mean it. Hour after hour she&#x2019;d held Leana&#x2019;s hand, pleading with her not<br>to die, praying for her with Neda and the others. Aye, she loved her<br>sister. But she loved Jamie as well. How could she possibly let him go?<br><br>He took her hand and led her toward the hall bench, pulling her<br>down onto the wooden seat next to him. &#x201c;Rose...&#x201d; His voice was as tender<br>as she&#x2019;d ever heard it. &#x201c;I saw you with Ian. You were born to be a<br>mother. And someday you will surely be one. But first you must find a<br>husband of your own.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Please, </i>Jamie!&#x201d; Did he not understand? Did he not <i>see? </i>&#x201c;<i>You </i>should<br>have been my husband. And Ian my son&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><i><br>&#x201c;Nae!&#x201d;</i>He fell back against the wall with a groan. &#x201c;I beg you, do not<br>say such things, Rose. &#x2019;Tis too late for all of that. God in his mercy<br>has forgiven my unfaithful heart, and I will not disappoint him&#x2013;or<br>Leana&#x2013;again.&#x201d;<br><br>Her heart sank. &#x201c;Instead you will disappoint me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye, it seems I must.&#x201d; Jamie turned toward her, his face a handbreadth<br>away. &#x201c;Forgive me, darling Rose. You were my first love; I cannot<br>deny it.&#x201d;<br><i><br>His first love. But not his last. </i>She closed her eyes. He was too near.<br><br>&#x201c;I may never care for Leana as I have for you. But I must try. Don&#x2019;t<br>you see?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I...&#x201d; She could hold back her tears no longer. &#x201c;I only see that you<br>don&#x2019;t want me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As my cousin, always. But not as my wife.&#x201d; His grip tightened.<br><br>&#x201c;You must let me go, Rose. For Ian&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d;<br><br>She stood, tugging her hands free to wipe her cheeks, looking away<br>lest he see the sorrow in her eyes. &#x201c;You ask too much of me, Jamie. You<br>ask...too much.&#x201d; She fled for the front door, stopping long enough to<br>fling her cloak over her shoulders before disappearing into the fogshrouded<br>night.</p><h2>Tales from Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle) (The Earthsea Cycle, 5)</h2><p>The tales of this book explore and extend the world established by the Earthsea novels--yet each stands on its own. It contains the novella "The Finder," and the short stories "The Bones of the Earth," "Darkrose and Diamond," "On the High Marsh," and&nbsp;"Dragonfly."&nbsp;Concluding with with an account of Earthsea's history, people, languages, literature, and magic, this collection also features two new maps of Earthsea.<br></p><p>Winner of five Nebula and five Hugo Awards, the National Book Award, the Newbery, and many other awards, Ursula K. Le Guin is one of the finest authors ever to write science fiction and fantasy. Her greatest creation may be the powerful, beautifully written, and deeply imagined Earthsea Cycle, which inhabits the rarified air at the pinnacle of modern fantasy with J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy and Jane Yolen's Chronicles of Great Alta. The books of the Earthsea Cycle are <i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i> (1968), <i>The Tombs of Atuan</i> (1971), <i>The Farthest Shore</i> (1972), the Nebula-winning <i>Tehanu</i> (1990), and now, <i>Tales of Earthsea</i> (2001).<p> If you have never read an Earthsea book, this collection isn't the place to start, as the author points out in her thoughtful foreword; begin with <i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i>. If you insist on starting with <i>Tales of Earthsea</i>, read the foreword and the appended "Description of Earthsea" before proceeding to the five stories (three of which are original to this book).</p><p> The opening story, "The Finder," occupies a third of the volume and has the strength and insight of a novel. This novella describes the youth of Otter, a powerful but half-trained sorcerer, and reveals how Otter came to an isle that cannot be found, and played a role in the founding of the great Roke School. "Darkrose and Diamond" tells of two lovers who would turn their backs on magic. In "The Bones of the Earth," an aging wizard and his distant pupil must somehow join forces to oppose an earthquake. Ged, the Archmage of Earthsea, appears in "On the High Marsh" to find the mad and dangerous mage he had driven from Roke Island. And in "Dragonfly," the closing story, a mysterious woman comes to the Roke School to challenge the rule that only men may be mages. "Dragonfly" takes place a few years after <i>Tehanu</i> and is the bridge between that novel and the next novel, <i>The Other Wind</i> (fall 2001). <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p><p>URSULA K.

Basque cooks are widely considered among the best in Europe, combining their love of fresh, simple ingredients with time-honored techniques. The joy of cooking and eating are central to Basque culture. In San Sebasti�n and throughout the region, men belong to cooking clubs, dedicated to the preservation of their outstanding cultural and culinary heritage. Outside the cooking societies, simple family meals turn into feasts of mammoth proportions, and everywhere conversation invariably turns to good food and the pursuit of it.</p><p> <em>The Basque Kitchen,</em> lusciously illustrated with photographs of the Basque region as well as its famous dishes, is the first major cookbook to explore Basque cooking on both sides of the border. Basque native Gerald Hirigoyen, named one of America s best chefs by <em>Food &amp; Wine</em> magazine, celebrates the food and memories of his beloved homeland. He shares recipes for his favorite Basque specialties, from traditional renditions of Salt Cod "al Pil-Pil" and Pip�rade to sumptuous soups, salads, meat, poultry, game, and of course, more seafood, all built on a bounty of fresh ingredients and carefully presented for the home cook. Hirigoyen's splendid interpretations have made his two San Francisco restaurants, Fringale and Pastis, critical favorites.</p></p><p>Sometimes, when you are Basque, you speak English with a French accent. Sometimes, that accent will sound a little more Spanish than not, and yet you are still Basque. Such are the complications of one of the more peculiar pockets of humanity to be found. For the country occupied by the Basque people is in both France and Spain while remaining unique unto itself. The Basque language is like no other, and no one knows where it comes from. Even Basque DNA is different than the DNA of other Europeans. Food--the taking of meals--is central to the culture. In some places it's a little more French than Spanish; in other places in Basque country, just the opposite is likely to be true.<p> Chef and restaurant owner Gerald Hirigoyen invites the reader into <i>The Basque Kitchen</i>. In page after delicious-looking page, Hirigoyen presents what he most loves about the cuisine. And rather than suggest that what he so loves remain frozen in a museum of cuisine, he embraces the foods and cooking techniques he has encountered in Paris and California. His Seared Ahi Tuna Steaks with Onion Marmalade honors his uncle's tuna and onion casserole. But instead of covering a tuna steak with onions and olive oil in a casserole and cooking a long time, Hirigoyen prepares an onion marmalade, then pan sears thick ahi steaks until they are hot and rare, and serves it all on a bed of lentils. He's saying that you have to be Basque to get there, but now that we have all arrived, we're somewhere else, yet connected.</p><p> And what a marvelous connection. The vast majority of the foods to be encountered between the covers of <i>The Basque Kitchen</i> are simple in nature, yet complex in the flavors they deliver. Potato and chorizo tortilla, an omelet of onion, potato, chorizo, salt, pepper, and parsley, gains added radiance with a little <i>piment d'Espelette</i>, powdered small, dried red peppers with a distinct flavor. Steamed mussels are prepared with tomatoes, crusty bread cubes, white wine, parsley, and chives. It's a dish from St.-Jean-de-Luz, over which the author proposed to his wife.</p><p> Gerald Hirigoyen brings to life the foods of his youth and family, as well as foods he has created from experience and whimsy. Refusing to be confined by tradition, Hirigoyen takes inspiration from Basque tradition and demonstrates the timelessness of the Basque kitchen. The benefits for one and all are right there, page after page after page. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>Join Gerald Hirigoyen and his wife, Cameron, and discover for yourself a culture and cuisine dedicated to pure gastronomic pleasures.

Richard Shelton first came to southeastern Arizona in the 1950s as a soldier stationed at Fort Huachuca. He soon fell in love with the region and upon his discharge found a job as a schoolteacher in nearby Bisbee. Now a university professor and respected poet living in Tucson, still in love with the Southwestern deserts, Shelton sets off for Bisbee on a not-uncommon day trip. Along the way, he reflects on the history of the area, on the beauty of the landscape, and on his own life.<br><br> Couched within the narrative of his journey are passages revealing Shelton's deep familiarity with the region's natural and human history. Whether conveying the mystique of tarantulas or describing the mountain-studded topography, he brings a poet's eye to this seemingly desolate country. His observations on human habitation touch on Tombstone, "the town too tough to die," on ghost towns that perhaps weren't as tough, and on Bisbee itself, a once prosperous mining town now an outpost for the arts and a destination for tourists. What he finds there is both a broad view of his past and a glimpse of that city's possible future.<br><br><i>Going Back to Bisbee</i> explores a part of America with which many readers may not be familiar. A rich store of information embedded in splendid prose, it shows that there are more than miles on the road to Bisbee.</p><p><b>Winner of the Western States Book Award for Creative Nonfiction</b><br><br> "From Tucson to Bisbee is only a hundred-mile trip through the basin and range country of southeastern Arizona, but Richard Shelton makes it a memorable ride through time and experience. . . a memoir rich in the history of the area and in wisdom about the natural world. . . . Shelton has a generous sense of humor, a clear vision of the world and, ultimately, wonderful stories to tell."&#x2014;Michael Pearson, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> "Humor, poignancy, humaneness, word magic&#x2014;these all make <i>Going Back To Bisbee</i> fit company with Dillard, Eiseley, Abbey, and Graves. . . . A beautiful book."&#x2014;<i>Journal of the West</i><br><br> "A poet of elegance and precision."&#x2014;<i>Harvard Review</i><br><br> "Poet-professor Shelton offers his first full-length prose work&#x2014;and it's cause for celebration. . . . recalls the violent history of this long-isolated border area. . . . Shelton's literary touch is sure, and he seemingly achieves his effects&#x2014;nostalgic, witty, inspirational&#x2014;with little effort. A delightful companion piece to Peter Mayle's <i>A Year in Provence</i>."&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> "He's a magician, hypnotizing his audience one moment with a tribute to coyotes, then waking them to a discussion of the Apache wars. . . . Shelton possesses great generosity of soul, a gift for observation, and golden sense of humor."&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br> "A powerful annal of place. . . . Shelton imbues landscapes, flora and fauna with resonance, imprinting themes of memory, history and human nature in the reader's mind. . . . Shelton knows the lore and life of Southern Arizona, and his diction, both precise and evocative, reflects his poetic skills."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> "There's so much in this book to discover, so many evocative passages and entertaining side trips."&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i><br><br> "A heartfelt memoir, a spectacular natural and social history of a spectacular land. It is as fine a book as you will read this year."&#x2014;<i>San Diego Tribune</i><br><br> "It enriches the life of the reader by reminding him of his own past. . . . A lyrical search to determine what has happened during a life lived and experienced."&#x2014;<i>El Paso Times</i>Poet-professor Shelton (English/Univ. of Arizona) offers his first full-length prose work--and it's cause for celebration. Enlivening his picaresque narrative with vivacity, humor, and an eye for significant detail, he proves to be a splendid traveling companion. Shelton frames his narrative with an 80-mile drive from his Tucson home to the Arizona mining town of Bisbee, where he began his marriage, his family, his career, and his enduring love affair with the southwestern desert. Along the way, he recalls the violent history of this long-isolated border area and reminisces about his life as a army draftee during the 50's and colorful friends and acquaintances--like the pair of bashful students whom he taught and later found working as prostitutes in a small Mexican town, and the crusty fellow teacher whose foul vocabulary blistered her colleagues' eardrums. Shelton is equally adept at evoking the landscape along his route--thunderheads like ``great white cathedrals,'' stands of scarlet-blossomed ocotillo, moldering ghost towns, and cottonwood-shaded streams. He confesses his affection for tarantulas and his puzzlement about just who is responsible for the vaguely ludicrous names given to bird species. There's a hilarious description of hundreds of jackrabbits devouring a prison lawn, and an admiring tribute to 80-year-old Ida Power, who, jaunty beret on head and feet firmly on the ground, led a drive to turn Bisbee from a dying company town into a vigorous arts center. As the odometer creeps forward, it becomes clear that Shelton's trip to Bisbee has assumed metaphorical meaning--that he is trying to return to the past and his youth. He handles this second level lightly, never lapsing into pretentiousness or excessive symbolism. Shelton's literary touch is sure, and he seemingly achieves his effects--nostalgic, witty, inspirational--with little effort. A delightful American companion piece to Peter Mayle's A Year in Provence. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Can we have confidence in our knowledge? Epistemology, the study of knowledge, can often seem like a daunting subject. And yet few topics are more basic to human life. We are inquisitive creatures by nature, and the unending quest for truth leads us to raise difficult questions about the quest itself. What are the conditions, sources and limits of our knowledge? Do our beliefs need to be rationally justified? Can we have certainty? In this primer on epistemology, James Dew and Mark Foreman guide students through this discipline in philosophy. By asking basic questions and using clear, jargon-free language, they provide an entry into some of the most important issues in contemporary philosophy.</p><p>James K. Dew Jr. (PhD, Southeastern Baptist) is associate professor of the history of ideas and philosophy and dean of the College at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. He has previously published <em>Science Theology: An Assessment of Alister McGrath's Critical Realist Perspective</em> (Wipf Stock).<br><br>Mark W. Foreman (PhD, University of Virginia) is associate professor of philosophy and religion at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. He is also the author of <em>Christianity and Bioethics: Confronting Clinical Issues</em>."<em>How Do We Know?</em> by James Dew Jr. and Mark Foreman is a theologically informed introductory guide to epistemology. Ideal for freshman-level courses or serious laypeople, it uses simple language to make the complex understandable." (CBA Retailers + Resources, April 2014)<br><br>"Dew and Foreman's <em>How Do We Know?</em> is a remarkably clear and concise discussion of central issues in epistemology. They explain difficult concepts as simply as possible without compromising accuracy, and they provide helpful illustrations throughout to ensure that readers will not get bogged down in the thicket of technical terminology. Epistemology is a field that can be as forbidding as it is important, and Dew and Foreman have done a wonderful service by giving us such an accessible treatment of the subject. Christian readers will find the book especially useful, as it includes discussions of faith, divine revelation and other issues related to religious epistemology. Another virtue of the book is the authors' discussion of many major figures in the history of philosophy as well as significant contemporary epistemologists. I highly recommend this text to anyone interested in epistemology as well as students of theology and philosophy of religion." (James S. Spiegel, Taylor University)<br><br>"Dew and Foreman have presented the reader with a very helpful introduction to a field with potential land mines. They have walked the epistemological field for the student, picked up jewels buried next to them, and presented them in a work that should be considered an excellent resource for college courses. How we come to have knowledge is too important to be left in obscurity. Bravo to the authors for clearing it up."

In mirroring the lives of the Dublin poor, from the tenement dwellers in <i>The Shadow of a Gunman</i> and <i>Juno and the Paycock</i> to the bricklayer, street vendor, and charwoman in <i>The Plough and the Stars</i>, Sean O'Casey conveys with urgency and eloquence the tiny details that create a total character as well as the terrors, large and small, that the constant threat of political violence inevitably brings. As Seamus Heaney has written, "O'Casey's characters are both down to earth and larger than life . . . His democratic genius was at one with his tragic understanding, and his recoil from tyranny and his compassion for the oppressed were an essential--as opposed to a moral and thematic--part of his art." </p><p>A new production of <i>Juno and the Paycock</i> will transfer from the Donmar Theatre in London to New York in September 2000.</p></p><p><p><b>Sean O'Casey</b> was born on March 30, 1880 in Dublin, Ireland. Other than the Dublin Trilogy, his many works include <i>The Star Turned Red</i>, <i>The Silver Tassie</i>, and <i>Purple Dust</i>. He died on September 18, 1964.</p><p>&#x201c;From the perspective of the 1990s O'Casey stands out as Ireland's greatest playwright of the century. He it was who most passionately, most powerfully and most memorably dramatized the traumatic birth of the nation. He it was who gave to the twentieth-century theatre a greater range of vivid and original characters, male and female, than any other Irish playwright.&#x201d; &#x2015;Christopher Murray, from Twentieth-Century Irish Drama</p><p>&#x201c;What's astonishing about these dramas, apart from the sheer richness and generosity of their humanity, is their ability, in Shakespeare's great phrase, 'to move wild laughter in the throat of death'.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Daily Telegraph, London</i></p></p><h2>Sweet Revenge (Goldy Schulz)</h2><p><p>Goldy Schulz is thrilled to be catering a holiday breakfast feast for the staff of the Aspen Meadow Library. But little does she know that on the menu is a large helping of murder. While setting up at the library, Goldy spots a woman lurking in the stacks who bears a striking resemblance to Sandee Brisbane&#x2014;the Sandee Brisbane who killed Goldy's ex-husband, the Jerk. But Sandee is supposed to be dead . . . or so everyone believes.</p><p>Goldy's suspicions mount when the body of Drew Wellington, a former district attorney, is found in a corner of the library, with a map worth thousands of dollars stashed in his clothing. Goldy is convinced that Sandee, a confessed felon, is involved. But the holiday madness is only just beginning for Goldy. Soon she's drawn into the dangerous, double-crossing world of high-end map dealing. And like the ghost of Christmas past, Sandee keeps making an appearance. Could she be out to prove that revenge is oh-so-sweet?</p></p><p><p>Diane Mott Davidson is the author of seventeen bestselling novels. She divides her time between Colorado and Florida.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> Bestseller Davidson is at the top of her form in her 14th culinary suspense novel to feature Colorado crime-solving caterer Goldy Schulz (after 2006's <i>Dark Tort</i>). As the Christmas season approaches, Goldy is thrilled to be catering not only a breakfast for the local library but also an elegant dinner for Hermie and Smithfield MacArthur, rich Southern transplants to Aspen Meadow. But when the body of Drew Wellington, the disgraced former DA, turns up in the library, Goldy is once again forced to put her recipes on the back burner and find the murderer. Discovering that Wellington was dabbling in antique map collecting, Goldy must track down a priceless map and steer clear of Wellington's fellow collectors, ex-girlfriends and clients. Further complicating matters are sightings of the allegedly deceased Sandee Brisbane, the young woman accused of murdering Goldy's ex-husband and then supposedly perishing in a forest fire. Readers will happily sink their teeth into Goldy's latest case and come away hungry for more. <i>11-city author tour. </i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This part of the Middle East&#x2014;no larger than modern-day Michigan&#x2014;was the birthplace of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. More than 35 projects include stomping grapes into juice, building a model Phoenician trading ship, making a Philistine headdress, and writing on a broken clay pot. Israelites', Phoenicians', and Philistines' writing and languages, the way they built their homes, the food they ate, the clothes they wore, and the work they did, and of course, their many interesting stories, are all explored.<br></p><p><b>Marian Broida</b> is the author of <i>Ancient Egyptians and Their Neighbors</i>.Grade 4-6-Broida's overview of the Israelites, Phoenicians, and Philistines focuses on their history, food, clothing, written language, occupations, religious beliefs, and architecture. The stories of the Bible (Old Testament) are related throughout and students may have a hard time differentiating between what archaeologists have interpreted and what has been taken solely from biblical texts. When describing what we "know" about Philistine military dress, the author notes that while we do not know exactly what the giant Goliath wore, "all we really know is that his clothes must have been extra-extra large!" This conversational tone does make for livelier reading, but it is often pointless. Interestingly enough, there is no citation for the Bible in the bibliography. Included are several activities and recipes for each group. The projects are fairly simple, using common materials, and the illustrations will help children interpret the narrative directions. A number of black-and-white photographs and simple maps are included. Admittedly there is little for children about these ancient cultures, but Jonathan N. Tubb's Bible Lands (DK, 2000) is a better introduction. Students could then use Broida's book to further their knowledge on these peoples.<br><i>Genevieve Gallagher, Orange County Public Library, VA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Loving Jesus</h2><p>The essence of spirituality is loving God, says Powell. The Bible, the Talmud, and the Qu&#39;ran all direct their followers not merely to believe in God, to trust God, to obey God, and to serve God - but to love God. Can we learn to love God? In this biblical spirituality for today, Powell&#39;s earnest plea is for Christians to revisit their faith not by blazing in religious enthusiasm but by harboring a steadier flame and deeper commitment. Living at the poetic heart of faith, he argues, entails seeing the coordinates of religious life in a new way. Powell espouses the old-fashioned idea of piety. Drawing on his wide knowledge of the Bible and Christian tradition, as well as insights from his own journey, he shows how simple religious practices move us beyond the old certitudes of a na�ve and youthful faith into the less certain but more bracing terrain of a second na�vet�, a closer walk with Jesus.</p><p>Mark Allan Powell is Leatherman Professor of New Testament at Trinity Lutheran Seminary in Columbus, Ohio.

An autoimmune condition (meaning it causes the body to attack itself, dramatically weakening the body's ability to ward off infections and other disease), celiac disease is hereditary and chronic. It's not a food allergy, and for those with celiac, avoiding gluten completely is the only way to live (literally). The cure: G-FREE food.<br><br>According to researchers at the University of Chicago, 1 in 133 people have celiac disease-meaning 3 million Americans alone! The problem is, only 1 percent of those with it have received a diagnosis. The rest of the pack likely lives with chronic, inexplicable abdominal pain, low energy, and a host of other symptoms. Thankfully, in the past five years, diagnosis has improved (thanks to great physicians like Dr. Peter Green, who not only diagnosed me but has devoted his career to treating patients as well as educating those in his field in order to properly flag and test for the disease) and labeling on foods is more accurate, allowing those with celiac to navigate the g-free world more easily.<br><br>Though not classified as a disease, gluten sensitivity (sometimes called non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or gluten intolerance) affects an approximate 6 percent of the American population, causing digestive aggravation when gluten is ingested. With improvements to testing for these conditions and education in the medical establishment, more and more people are getting clear diagnoses and are beginning to go in search of gluten-free foods. The community of those eating g-free is therefore expanding, and we are hungry!<br><br>I wrote in great detail of the roadblocks I faced in my own journey to diagnosis, and the tips and strategies I learned as I began to eat food that would not make me sick, in my first book, The G-Free Diet. To this day, I hear from people from all walks of life-moms, dads, friends, colleagues, and even strangers on the street-who tell me that The G-Free Diet is a friend to them, an easy reference to navigating the proverbial food waters g-free style.<br><br>Whether you have celiac or gluten sensitivity (or even if you simply want to stop eating gluten for other health or energy reasons), your goals are to replace glutenous grains with more impactful, less harmful gluten-free grains; to avoid any kind of cross-contamination in your kitchen (and be on guard for it in restaurants and at parties); and to effectively and confidently communicate your food situation to those around you.<br><br>Creating a safe cooking haven for yourself-a completely g-free kitchen- will meet those goals. Living with a completely g-free kitchen will mean that any crumbs are not immediately suspect, and it'll mean less double washing and cleaning!<br><br>If this change is just not possible for you-perhaps you are aiming to please a houseful of non-g-free-ers in addition to your own needs-what I call "the hybrid kitchen" will be more your style. In my own home, I'd say we currently have a 60 percent g-free kitchen, though every day the percentage is growing as we find more and more products (and develop them, too) that are safe for my sensitive digestive system.<br><br>The initial step of g-freeing your kitchen to whatever extent you are able will pay big dividends in the end. The more g-free your kitchen, the less stress you will have when addressing cross-contamination. Simple steps have made food preparation a lot less worrisome for me- and they will for you, too.<br><br>STORING G-FREE PRODUCTS<br><br>I recently went into a coffee shop that sold g-free treats. The problem, though, was that they were on the shelf below the gluten-<br><br>containing muffins, which rained crumbs all over the supposedly g-free offerings every time one was pulled out.<br><br>With this in mind, think of anything with gluten like a leaking pen. Anything that it travels over will be "inked." Therefore, one of the most important considerations in a hybrid kitchen is where you store your products. If you can't dedicate a whole cabinet to g-free ingredients alone, you can still avoid gluten contamination by following this handy rule of thumb: Gluten "goes low" and g-free "flies high." That is, store your g-free products above the others. If you were to store gluten above g-free, you would run the risk of crumbs from gluten products falling into the g-free packaging or containers, as they did in that coffee shop.<br><br>Here's another rule of thumb: On a buffet, place g-free dishes first and in the front, and gluten options last and in the back. This way, there is less "fly-over," less possibility that gluten options will drip into or fall onto the g-free platters as people make their way down the line.<br><br>When setting up your hybrid g-free kitchen, remember my rule of thumb: Gluten goes low, g-free flies high! On a buffet, avoid "fly-over" contamination by placing g-free platters and dishes where your family and guests will serve themselves first.<br><br>Cool Storage<br><br>In my home, the refrigerator is already a mostly gluten-free zone, without our having to try too hard to make it so. Fresh foods (like vegetables, fruits, meats, dairy, and herbs) are naturally gluten- free, and most of our jarred foods and condiments long ago got a g- free makeover (everything from ketchup to mayo and syrups and flavorings now come in g-free brands) because having two of everything overcrowded the fridge. For products that we go through quickly, like peanut butter and jelly, we do stock both options, but I use labels on the g-free versions so that a knife that just made the trip across a piece of whole wheat bread does not go for a dip in my g-free jar.<br><br>As with the kitchen cabinets, I keep the non-g-free foods on the bottom shelf of the fridge so that if anything falls, drips, or spills out of a gluten-containing leftover or soupy dish, it does not travel over the items that are g-free. If g-free offerings will be in the minority in your fridge, keep them in a plastic tub (also labeled) to protect them from the g-full food.<br><br>Space permitting, many g-free families find that a small, dedicated "g- free-zer" is a huge time- and worry-saver. Try storing a supply of deliciously g-free cupcakes (pages 194-198), muffins (pages 43-48), g- free pizza dough (page 170), the double batch of chicken tenders (page 83), and cookie dough (page 215) this way. At a minimum, I recommend that you set aside a section of your freezer for non-g-free foods just the way you did in your fridge. Be sure to use the location rules, and keep your breaded non-<br><br>g-free chicken tenders or nuggets below or behind the g-free versions.<br><br>Dry Storage<br><br>Once you start cooking from the recipes in this book, I hope you will feel that g-free flours, pastas, and flavorings are just as good as, if not better than, the gluten-heavy versions you might now have in your pantry. As g-free replacements begin to take up greater real estate in your kitchen, you might actually be looking to donate the boxes of pasta, unopened bags of flour, and a whole range of other ingredients that you just don't need around anymore! Or you might be inclined to have a "going away party" for your glutenous goodies: a big bakeoff and last hoorah.<br><br>Even if you're not giving your gluten products away entirely, when creating a hybrid kitchen it's a good idea to make a fresh start with your pantry. Opened bags of flour or boxes of pasta can rain potential contaminants onto your shelves and into the cracks and corners between them. Give your pantry, cupboards, and silverware drawers a thorough "spring cleaning," wiping them out with soap and hot water. For safe measure, put all your silverware and cooking utensils through a sanitizing dishwasher cycle, too.<br><br>Think about the crumbs that find their way into your cooking utensil or silverware drawers. Go ahead-I dare you to take a look right now! It's amazing how many crumbs congregate there, isn't it? You may not have the flexibility in your kitchen to move your silverware and utensils to a spot away from where food is prepared, but do strive to place your breadbox somewhere other than over your utensil drawer (and don't store any glutenous snacks on top of where the drawer opens). This will dramatically cut down on any possible contamination to the silverware and utensils you rely on, and it's one of the most effective (and easy) g-free steps you can take.<br><br>In our house, the breadbox is where we keep glutenous items-bread, baked goods-because it's a way to keep them separate from the rest of the kitchen. I happen to give my g-free baked goods the prime display space: a glass-covered cake dish on my counter! For extended storage, I place g-free breads and baked treats in the freezer or fridge. Whatever you decide to do, the key is to be consistent: explain the new system to the family, babysitters, houseguests, etc., and stick to it!<br><br>Be Loud and Clear<br><br>Once you've decided on your organizational system, do yourself the big favor of labeling containers and cookware (including knives, if one will be used for cutting or spreading with exclusively g-free foods) in a way that will remind the family to stick with the program. Use a label maker, a brand of labels that really adhere (I like Mabel's Labels or Stuck on You labels, which stick even when they go through a dishwasher), or a Sharpie pen, so that there's no confusion about what is g-free. Label drawers, shelves, bags of flours, jars of peanut butter and mayo. If there is a label on it, everyone will know that it is gluten-free. What a worry-saver for you, the person trying to avoid gluten altogether!<br><br>Here are some other handy tips for setting up and working in a hybrid kitchen:<br><br>Dishcloths, sponges, and scrubbers are hiding places for gluten if they've been used to clean up after a gluten meal. Keep a g-free set of them in a designated spot.<br><br>Even if you've designated several sponges or scrubbers for g-free use, run them through the dishwasher every time it cycles to banish g- crumbs and buildup that may have come through exposure to gluten food.<br><br>Develop a simple system for wiping down the countertop before cooking your evening meal. Use soap and hot water, and the sponge or cloth that you've designated for g-free use. Better safe than sorry. If you have celiac disease, it takes only 1/8 teaspoon of gluten a day to damage the intestine. Every crumb counts.<br><br>Paper towels are the unsung hero of any kitchen-think about how often you use them!-but nowhere more so than in the hybrid kitchen. If you don't know which dishcloth or sponge is the g-free one, grab a paper towel for a fast and effective wipe down or hand drying.<br><br>Be sure to inspect the ingredients in the soap and hand lotion you keep by your kitchen sink to make sure that there is no gluten in them. Think about it: If you wash or moisturize your hands (or both) and then turn your attention to, say, making a salad, you may well be contaminating the lettuce with the trace gluten on your hands.<br><br>READY, SET, COOK!<br><br>Okay, your kitchen is clean, organized, and ready to go. You want to get down to business, so what about cooking equipment? There is no need to invest in a whole new set of cookware to set your kitchen up for g-free gourmet goodness, but there are a few things to consider for safety.<br><br>Plastic<br><br>Plastic can trap gluten if it is badly scratched and really worn. Relegate scratched plastic containers to the gluten cabinet or invest in a set of glass storage containers that will last a lifetime and can easily be washed if something with gluten does mistakenly get stored in them. If you don't choose to label your containers as<br><br>g-free and gluten-allowed, use two sets with different-colored tops to make the difference clear for everyone.<br><br>Baking Pans and Baking Sheets<br><br>If you have an old family pie dish or cake pan-inherited from your grandmother's kitchen, perhaps-there is a fast and simple solution to continuing to use it in your gluten-free cooking: line pie dishes or cake pans with aluminum foil, and spread parchment paper or foil over the baking sheet. Since cupcakes and muffins are regularly requested at my house (and since I find that cookies tend to stick to foil, even when it's greased), I have a designated and completely g-free muffin tin, and to avoid mishaps I also have two designated g-free baking sheets.<br><br>Since my diagnosis with celiac disease, I have been steadily building up a g-free set of kitchen items. My wish list for birthdays always includes a "double" of something I've had in my kitchen since Tim and I got married: a pot, a pan, a mixing bowl, a set of knives, a cutting board. This is a slow but steady way to duplicate the basic equipment we've been using, and a good way to substitute g-free items as the older ones get scuffed, stained, and cracked.<br><br>Stainless Steel<br><br>One-hundred-percent stainless steel pots and pans are a go! I recommend scrubbing them well with plenty of dishwashing soap and then also running them through the dishwasher before considering them a part of your g-free tool set.<br><br>Glass<br><br>Glass is a nonporous surface, so once they are really clean, glass bowls and bakeware will be a great asset to you. They are great for mixing, measuring, and baking. Glass baking dishes tend to conduct heat faster than metal, though, so to avoid dry baked goods, be careful with recommended cook times. My mom usually made brownies in a Pyrex dish-the smooth surface is so easy to clean-and so do I.<br><br>Nonstick<br><br>Some nonstick surfaces like Teflon may trap gluten if they are damaged and/or not washed properly. I use ceramic-lined pans for a healthier nonstick surface. Investing in one large ceramic-lined frying pan for recipes like chicken fingers (page 85), and one small one for eggs, like the omelet (page 31) and frittata (page 35), is ideal. Of course, if your entire kitchen is g-free, and not hybrid, any pan you have will work.<br><br>Utensils and Knives<br><br>Just like stainless steel pots and pans, stainless steel utensils are safe if they are properly cleaned. Stainless steel knives are a must and are very durable; an 8-inch chef's knife and one or two paring knives are all you'll need for the recipes in this book. If you already own stainless steel knives, just be sure to take extra time to clean around the handle and hilt to be sure no food particles linger in any crevices.<br><br>A flexible high-heat nylon or silicone spatula is a great, inexpensive addition to your gluten-free utensil drawer and will make flipping eggs and pancakes easier. (Sometimes they can be a little too floppy, though, so select one that you can maneuver well.)</p><h2>Sincerity and Authenticity (The Charles Eliot Norton Lectures)</h2><p>"Now and then," writes Lionel Triling "it is possible to observe the moral life in process of revising itself." In this new book he is concerned with such a mutation: the process by which the arduous enterprise of sincerity, of being true to one's self, came to occupy a place of supreme importance in the moral life--and the further shift which finds that place now usurped by the darker and still more strenuous modern ideal of authenticity. Instances range over the whole of Western literature and thought, from Shakespeare to Hegel to Sartre, from Robespierre to R.D. Laing, suggesting the contradictions and ironies to which the ideals of sincerity and authenticity give rise, most especially in contemporary life. Lucid, and brilliantly framed, its view of cultural history will give <i>Sincerity and Authenticity</i> an important place among the works of this distinguished critic.</p><p>In this new book he is concerned with such a mutation: the process by which the arduous enterprise of sincerity, of being true to one&#39;s self, came to occupy a place of supreme importance in the moral life.At the time of his death in 1975, Lionel Trilling was University Professor at Columbia University.</p><h2>Latin for Children, A DVD</h2><p>Imagine having an experienced Latin teacher walk right into your home and sit down to teach your students.

The subtle analyses presented in this treatise were closely studied and commented upon by many realized masters from the Indo-Tibetan Buddhist tradition. <br><br>Using Nagarjuna's root text and the great modern master Ju Mipham's commentary as a framework, Khenpo Ts�ltrim Gyamtso explains the most important verse from each chapter in the text in a style that illuminates for modern students both the meaning of these profound teachings and how to put them into practice in a way that benefits both oneself and others.</p><p>Khenpo Ts�ltrim Gyamtso is a noted Buddhist scholar and teacher who was born in Eastern Tibet in 1934. Known for his highly engaging teaching style, he has traveled and taught in North America, Europe, and Asia from 1977 to 2007. He is the author of <i>The Sun of Wisdom</i>, <i>The Moon of Wisdom</i>, and <i>Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness</i>, and numerous songs of realization."Consummately readable . . . a unique combination of scholarly acumen and spirited engagement towards what might otherwise seem like dry and difficult material to the average reader."&#x2014; <i>Buddhadharma</i></p><h2>Prayers of a Young Poet</h2><p>This volume marks the first translation of these prayer-poems into English. Originally written in 1899, Rilke wrote them upon returning to Germany from his first trip to Russia. His experience of the East shaped him profoundly. He found himself entranced by Orthodox churches and monasteries, above all by the icons that seemed to him like flames glowing in dark spaces. He intended these poems as icons of sorts, gestures that could illumine a way for seekers in the darkness. As Rilke here writes, &#34;I love the dark hours of my being, for they deepen my senses.&#34;</p><p>A ground-breaking volume that presents, for the first time in English, these prayer-poems as Rilke intended them"This extraordinary early-draft form of some of Rilke's most famous poems somehow evokes, for me, Leonardo Da Vinci's notebooks--it shows the same mix of surety, roughness, genius, and the sense of precipitous creative speed. Rilke's poetry always reminds us what a direct pondering of intimacy and depth might look like. I am most grateful for these muscular translations and Mark Burrows' extended introductory comments, offering entrance to a body of work until now unavailable to English-language readers."<br> --Jane Hirshfield, poet and translator; author most recently of "Come, Thief: Poems" ""Prayers of a Young Poet" is a hauntingly beautiful book. Mark Burrows' splendid translation renders the passion and the pathos of the anonymous young monk who sings these love songs to the Lord and somehow speaks our hidden desire. In these pages, Rilke dances in the dark to the tune of his own poems, his reluctant partner the elusive God he woos. The effect is irresistible: an invitation to join in the dance no reader can refuse." <br>--Angela Alaimo O'Donnell, poet and author of "Saint Sinatra &amp; Other Poems" "Rilke's praying monk begins with the time-honored conventions of his religious tradition, then moves beyond them to the dark silences of forest and dream where God waits to be discovered anew. In these startling poems brought to us in Mark Burrows' lucid translation, metaphor gives way to metaphor, as each verbal foray into the divine courts a mystery that can be approached but neither comprehended nor defined."<br>--Peter S. Hawkins, Professor of Religion and Literature, Yale Divinity School<p>Rilke wrote these poems in 1899 after returning to Germany from his first trip to Russia, calling them simply &#x201c;the prayers.&#x201d;&nbsp; They reflect the intensity of his experience of the East, voicing his fascination with Orthodox churches and monasteries.&nbsp; The icons, so different than the religious art he encountered on an earlier trip to Italy, seemed to him like flames glowing in dark spaces.&nbsp; These luminous prayers gesture as verbal icons, their images illumining a way in the darkness for seekers of the sacred.&nbsp; As he here writes:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I love the dark hours of my being,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for they deepen my senses . &nbsp;. &nbsp;.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From them I&#x2019;ve come to know that I have room</p><p>for a second life, timeless and wide.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>&#x201c;How perfect that Mark Burrows is as fine a scholar as he is a poet.

The American Revolution has turned the Atlantic coast into a refuge for privateers and marauding French warships, and it is up to young Bolitho to fight the colonial rebels, to stave off the treachery of a beautiful woman, and to overcome the dangerous incompetence of a senior officer before it is too late.</p><p>Alexander Kent, pen name of Douglas Edward Reeman, joined the British Navy at 16, serving on destroyers and small craft during World War II, and eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant. He has taught navigation to yachtsmen and has served as a script adviser for television and films. His books have been translated into nearly two dozen languages.A young and earnest Captain Richard Bolitho bravely faces the shot and ball thrown at his British ship by American patriots, managing one narrow escape by sailing over a shallow bar. Michael Jayston's raspy voice is deep and sure of itself as it spins these sea yarns. In the way of a good storyteller, he sometimes gets excited or takes on an accent, but he always stays easily understood. The author's muse contributes "tightly reefed topsails, the clank of pumps, and the smell of gun smoke in battle" to provide the narrator with stories of the Revolutionary War that are both educational and in good taste.

They represent the crowning achievements of his career.<br><br>O&#x2019;Neill described&nbsp;<i>Ah, Wilderness!</i>&nbsp;as &#x201c;the way I would have&nbsp;<i>liked</i>&nbsp;my boyhood to have been.&#x201d; Set in the summer of 1906, it affectionately depicts the warm, close family of sixteen-year-old Richard Miller and the innocence with which he faces the trials of first love, strong drink, and sexual temptation.<br><br>John Loving, hero of&nbsp;<i>Days Without End</i>, is split by his lack of faith into two selves: John and his Mephistophelian double Loving, who wears John&#x2019;s death mask and plots his destruction.

This volume presents the never-before-published complete text of the revised typescript for this unfinished play.<br><br>The derelict inhabitants of Harry Hope&#x2019;s saloon in&nbsp;<i>The Iceman Cometh</i>&nbsp;find solace in their comradeship until their drifting calm is destroyed by the visiting salesman Theodore Hickey, who insists that they abandon all &#x201c;pipe dreams&#x201d; and face the truth about their lives.

With no uniquely American tradition to guide him, O'Neill introduced various dramatic techniques, which subsequently became staples of the U.S. theater. By 1914 he had written twelve one-act and two long plays. Of this early work, only <b>Thirst and Other One-act plays</b> (1914) was originally published. From this point on, O'Neill's work falls roughly into three phases: the early plays, written from 1914 to 1921 (<b>The Long Voyage Home</b>, <b>The Moon of the Caribbees</b>, <b>Beyond the Horizon</b>, <b>Anna Christie</b>); a variety of full-length plays for Broadway (<b>Desire Under the Elms</b>; <b>Great God Brown</b>; <b>Ah, Wilderness!</b>); and the last, great plays, written between 1938 and his death (<b>The Iceman Cometh</b>, <b>Long Day's Journey Into Night</b>, <b>A Moon for the Misbegotten</b>). Eugene O'Neill is a four-time Pulitzer Prize winner, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 1936.O'Neill specialist Bogard gathers together for the first time the full canon of O'Neill's drama50 plays plus his only short story, "Tomorrow." The texts, arranged chronologically by the year they were written, incorporate O'Neill's final revisions and contain notes and a chronology of his life. No serious literature collection is complete without the full set of O'Neill.

They are offered with great warmth and wisdom by a person who is both an anthropologist and a missionary. . . . With the addition of some questions for further thought and suggestions for reading, this book will make a good textbook in the field of missionary anthropology."<br>--<b>Gottfried Oosterwal</b>, <i>Religious Studies Review</i><br><br>"In this book Paul Hiebert has pulled together an impressive array of insights (from his own missionary experience and from the experience of other missionaries) which anthropology offers the would-be missionary. . . . The book has been written in an easy-to-read, straightforward style. Hiebert provides an abundance of primary sources for those who might want to pursue further individual insights. It is a book that will be valuable to mission executives, missionary candidates, and even experienced missionaries."<br>--<b>Jacob A. Loewen</b>, <i>Missiology</i><br><br>"This is a book that needed to be written. . . . No single volume focuses the insights derived from the study of anthropology so comprehensively and yet so practically on the life and work of the average evangelical missionary as does this one. While ideal as a supplementary text for a course in missionary anthropology, this book can be read with real profit by anyone engaged in or contemplating a cross-cultural ministry. . . . The book is replete with helpful tables, charts, diagrams, and carefully selected excerpts from other writers. . . . This is the kind of book that deserves to be read not only at the beginning of one's missionary career but also at five-year intervals thereafter."<br>--<b>Kenneth Mulholland</b>, <i>Evangelical Missions Quarterly</i><br><br>"[Hiebert] provides a sound treatment both of culture and of the gospel that denies the complexity of neither. He treats the task of living in another culture with much practical wisdom and a good deal of intellectual sophistication. He presents a thoroughly sound and persuasive approach to contextualization and the communication of the gospel. . . . This is all done in clear, nonjargony language. Effective charts and diagrams sprinkle the text and go a long way toward illustrating difficult concepts and ideas. . . . This book is believable, convincing, and practical. . . . It would be useful for courses in applied anthropology, missiology and missionary preparation, and the theory of culture."<br>--Harley Schreck, <i>Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith</i>The late <b>Paul G. Hiebert </b>(1932-2007) was distinguished professor of mission and anthropology at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School and previously taught at Fuller Theological Seminary.

Now you can read all five novels in one volume: <i>Never Mind, Bad News, Mother's Milk, Some Hope, and At Last</i>.</p><p>By turns harrowing and hilarious, this ambitious novel cycle dissects the English upper class. Edward St. Aubyn offers his reader the often darkly funny and self-loathing world of privilege as we follow Patrick Melrose's story of abuse, addiction, and recovery from the age of five into early middle age.</p><p>The Patrick Melrose Novels are "a memorable tour de force" (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>) by one of "the most brilliant English novelists of his generation" (Alan Hollinghurst).</p></p><p><b>EDWARD ST.

Here the immediacy of Chuang Tzu's language is restored in a idiom that is both completely fresh and true to the original text. This unique collaboration between one of America's premier poet-translators and a leading Chinese scholar presents the so-called "Inner Chapters" of the text, along with important selections from other chapters thought to have been written by Chuang Tzu's disciples.</p><p>If you have looked long at the serene freedom of a Chinese painting or been baffled by a Zen koan or been knocked off your stool by a Beat poet, you have met Chuang Tzu (Zhuangzi). If you would like to get to know him better, spend some time with poet Sam Hamill and scholar J.P. Seaton's translation of <i>The Essential Teachings of Chuang Tzu</i>. <p> Of the 33 chapters in the original, Hamill and Seaton render 19 completely and 3 partially into a naturally flowing English idiom that captures the vibrancy, humor, and playful sincerity of Chuang Tzu's language. Chuang Tzu offers insights more than teachings, startlingly transparent nuggets of wisdom in short episodes with colorful characters and trenchant punch lines. His overarching themes of freedom, living naturally, using the useless, the interconnectedness of all things, natural transformation, and such materialize as the eye meanders from passage to passage. Here is a concise, fluent rendition that makes reading Chuang Tzu almost as much fun as wandering free and easy through the infinite. <i>--Brian Bruya</i></p>Sam Hamill has translated more than two dozen books from ancient Chinese, Japanese, Greek, Latin, and Estonian.

But what of the real life Durrells? Why did they go to Corfu in the first place - and what happened to them after they left?<br><br> The real story of the Durrells is as surprising and fascinating as anything in Gerry's books, and Michael Haag, with his first hand knowledge of the family, is the ideal narrator, drawing on diaries, letters and unpublished autobiographical fragments. <br><br> <i>The Durrells of Corfu </i> describes the family's upbringing in India and the crisis that brought them to England and then Greece. It recalls the genuine characters they encountered on Corfu - Theodore the biologist, the taxi driver Spiro Halikiopoulos and the prisoner Kosti - as well as the visit of American writer Henry Miller. And Haag has unearthed the story of how the Durrells left Corfu, including Margo's and Larry's last-minute escapes before the war. An extended epilogue looks at the emergence of Larry as a world famous novelist, and Gerry as a naturalist and champion of endangered species, as well as the lives of the rest of the family, their friends and other animals. <br><br> The book is illustrated with family photos from the Gerald Durrell Archive, many of them reproduced here for the first time.</p><p>Michael Haag knew Lawrence Durrell (and met Gerry and Margo) and is currently writing a biography of Lawrence Durrell for Yale University Press, which also published his Alexandria: City of Memory, a definitive study of Cavafy, Forster and Lawrence Durrell in the city. Haag is also author of a dozen books, including and <i>The Quest for Mary Magdalene</i>.'This real life story of the Durrell family is fascinating - Haag brilliantly traces their footsteps in pre-war Corfu, England and India' -Simon Nye, Writer, TV's <i>The Durrells</i> <br><br> 'Family stories are worth telling, and this one is fascinatingly put together by Michael Haag. For few families present such an entertaining patchwork tale as the Durrells.' -<i>Daily Mail</i> <br><br> 'Haag vividly evokes the time and the place with sumptuous descriptions ... [he] has written a love letter to an extraordinary family. As families and other animals go, the Durrells are a breed of their own.' - <i>Daily Express</i> <br><br> 'Haag adds sadness and depth to a story that is superficially golden and charming, and which never stops being so. There is so much lustre here that nothing can tarnish it; the complications and grievances only make you admire the Durrells more. What a family, and what lives well lived' - <i>Sunday Times</i></p><h2>The Tao of Vegetable Gardening: Cultivating Tomatoes, Greens, Peas, Beans, Squash, Joy, and Serenity</h2><p><p><em>The Tao of Vegetable Gardening</em> explores the practical methods as well as the deeper essence of gardening. In her latest book, groundbreaking garden writer Carol Deppe (<em>The Resilient Gardener</em>, <em>Breed Your Own Vegetable Varieties</em>) focuses on some of the most popular home garden vegetables&#x2015;tomatoes, green beans, peas, and leafy greens&#x2015;and through them illustrates the key principles and practices that gardeners need to know to successfully plant and grow just about any food crop.<br> <br> Deppe&#x2019;s work has long been inspired and informed by the philosophy and wisdom of <em>Tao Te Ching</em>, the 2,500-year-old work attributed to Chinese sage Lao Tzu and the most translated book in the world after the Bible. <em>The Tao of Vegetable Gardening</em> is organized into chapters that echo fundamental Taoist concepts: Balance, Flexibility, Honoring the Essential Nature (your own and that of your plants), Effortless Effort, Non-Doing, and even Non-Knowing. Yet the book also offers a wealth of specific and valuable garden advice on topics as diverse as:<br> <br> �&nbsp; &nbsp; The Eat-All Greens Garden, a labor- and space-efficient way to provide all the greens a family can eat, freeze, and dry&#x2015;all on a tiny piece of land suitable for small-scale and urban gardeners.</p> <p>�&nbsp; &nbsp; The growing problem of late blight and the future of heirloom tomatoes&#x2015;and what gardeners can do to avoid problems, and even create new resistant varieties.</p> <p>�&nbsp; &nbsp; Establishing a Do-It-Yourself Seed Bank, including information on preparing seeds for long-term storage and how to &#x201c;dehybridize&#x201d; hybrids.</p> <p>�&nbsp; &nbsp; Twenty-four good places to not plant a tree, and thirty-seven good reasons for not planting various vegetables.<br> <br> Designed for gardeners of all levels, from beginners to experienced growers, <em>The Tao of Vegetable Gardening</em> provides a unique frame of reference: a window to the world of nature, in the garden and in ourselves.</p></p><p><p>Oregon plant breeder Carol Deppe, author of <em>The Tao of Vegetable Gardening</em>, holds a PhD in biology from Harvard University and specializes in developing public-domain crops for organic growing conditions, sustainable agriculture, and human survival for the next thousand years. Carol is author of <em>The Resilient Gardener: Food Production and Self-Reliance in Uncertain Times</em> (Chelsea Green, 2010),&nbsp;<em>Breed Your Own Vegetable Varieties, 2nd ed.</em> (Chelsea Green, 2000),&nbsp;<em>Tao Te Ching: A Window to the Tao through the Words of Lao Tzu</em> (Fertile Valley Publishing, 2010), and&nbsp;<em>Taoist Stories</em> (Fertile Valley Publishing, 2014). Visit www.caroldeppe.com for articles and further adventures.</p><p><strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em>-</strong></p> <p>"This thoughtful book is a guide for growing tomatoes, squash, and greens, but its most significant contribution is Deppe&#x2019;s approach to gardening. She encourages the gardener to cultivate an intuitive relationship with plants and almost a sixth sense about when to actively work in the garden, and when to stand back and let the plants do the growing they need to do. She calls it the Tao of gardening, a form of 'non-doing' or 'doing that which gives maximum effect for the minimum effort,' so that unnecessary action has been eliminated. It is about balance: not watering too much, not fertilizing too much. She further enjoins the gardener to create a relationship with the garden, knowing what needs tending what needs to be left alone. The advice for raising tomatoes and greens will benefit the gardener, but the magic of the book is the way it teaches the gardener how to grow with the garden.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;With the insight of a skilled breeder Carol Deppe has drawn together the best of ancient wisdom and traditional crops. Gardeners rejoice! The past has never promised us a better future than in these pages.&#x201d;<strong>--Roger B. Swain, host of PBS&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Victory Garden&#x201d;</strong></p><br><br><p>"In <em>The Tao of Vegetable Gardening</em> Carol Deppe uses Taoist philosophical concepts to communicate gardening wisdom learned through longtime practice and experimentation. She seemlessly integrates excellent how-to advice with her reflections on cultivation, plants, soil, the elements, and life. This book is as profound as it is practical, and will be a great source of information and inspiration for both experienced gardeners and those just starting out."<strong>--Sandor Ellix Katz, author, <em>The Art of Fermentation</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;There are many knowledgeable gardeners but very few wise ones. Carol Deppe is both. Her excellent new book, <em>The Tao of Vegetable Gardening, </em>serves up generous portions of homegrown know-how gleaned from three decades worth of experimentation. It will, no doubt, make you a better gardener. What sets this book apart, though, is its potential for making us into happier gardeners by sharing the deeper life lessons our gardens have to teach. The Chinese word <em>tao </em>can be defined in different ways but my favorite is "path," and Carol Deppe shows us that the timeless path to health, happiness and wholeness cuts right through our own backyard, if we choose to take it.&#x201d;<strong>--Roger Doiron, Founding Director, Kitchen Gardeners International</strong>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Why do different ripe tomatoes harvested from the same plant in the same season&nbsp;taste different? What does bean seed color have to do with vigor and flavor?&nbsp;After nearly forty years in the seed business, I still learn amazing things from each new book by Carol Deppe. <em>The Tao of Vegetable Gardening</em> melds the observational skills and curiosity of a molecular geneticist with the sheer joy and inner harmonies of a practicing participant in the garden's dance of life.&#x201d;<strong>--CR Lawn, founder, Fedco Seeds</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>The Tao of Vegetable Gardening</em> is another absolutely brilliant book from Carol Deppe. It&#x2019;s smart, ultimately sensible, refreshing in the way old assumptions get questioned, vastly informative about gardening&#x2015;plus it&#x2019;s a really good read. I mean, how many gardening books make you laugh out loud and get you to pick up the phone and order a tool from a place called Red Pig? I&#x2019;m so grateful for this book&#x2015;I will have it memorized by the time the soil is ready to work.&#x201d;<strong>--Deborah Madison, author, <em>Vegetable Literacy&nbsp;</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;If you want to read the complete, deepest-down lowdown on how to grow organic vegetables successfully, this is the book. It also stands as a guide to the most genuine, independent lifestyle possible, relying only on nature and the author's awesomely detailed knowledge of plant life to achieve successful food production and a contented way of life. The reader learns not only how to grow and cook vegetables, but how to breed new varieties and save the seed. And while you read her book, you are also charmed with the Tao philosophy of living--something I have come to believe is a sure path to tranquility.&#x201d;<strong>--Gene Logsdon, author, <em>Gene Everlasting </em>and <em>The Contrary Farmer</em></strong></p><br><br><p><strong><em>Booklist</em>-</strong></p> <p>"Biologist and plant breeder Deppe (The Resilient Gardener, 2010) shares principles and practices that will 'allow a gardener to do nothing whatsoever after sowing the seed until it is time to come back and&nbsp;harvest.' Such wonderful pragmatism does not mean that this is a cut-and-dried how-to. Far from it. Deppe&nbsp;is lively, thoroughly engaged, and cheerfully direct, and her use of the tao is no gimmick. She infuses her&nbsp;in-depth, hands-on guide to growing, harvesting, preparing, and eating the most popular and nutritional&nbsp;vegetables with pithy and resonant philosophical observations, including such aphorisms as these, which&nbsp;preface the weeding section: 'Deal with the small before it is large. Deal with the few before they are&nbsp;many.' Age-old wisdom graces comprehensive, clear, and timely instructions on every aspect of vegetable&nbsp;cultivation and enjoyment, including Deppe&#x2019;s guidance in avoiding late blight, the disease now threatening&nbsp;heirloom tomatoes, and her 'eat-all greens' strategy for growing succulent kale, mustard, and other leafy&nbsp;greens. Whether writing about squash or serenity, Deppe is pleasurable and enlightening company, and&nbsp;this is a vegetable gardener&#x2019;s treasury.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Journal Junkies Workshop: Visual Ammunition for the Art Addict</h2><p><p><b>YOUR MISSION: Discover the tactical secret of self expression--the art journal!</b></p><p>Harness the artistic explosion ticking in your head, just looking for a creative way to detonate.

He is a screenwriter, with early notable success on BBC's legendary <i>Doctor Who</i>, for which he wrote some episodes now widely regarded as classics, and which even he is quite fond of. After a decade of such work, he decided it was time to show the world what he could really do, and embarked on his first serious original novel.

Or it might have been someone&#x2019;s brakes or a distant siren or an Airbus on final approach to Heathrow.</p><p>I&#x2019;d been hearing him off and on since stepping off the top of a tower block in Elephant and Castle. Not a real sound, you understand&#x2014;an impression, an expression through the city itself&#x2014;what we might call a super-<i>vestigia</i> if Nightingale wasn&#x2019;t so dead set against me making up my own terminology.</p><p>Sometimes he&#x2019;s in a threatening mood, sometimes I hear him as a thin wail of despair in among the wind moaning around a tube train. Or else he&#x2019;s pleading and wheedling in the growl of late-night traffic beyond my bedroom window. He&#x2019;s a mercurial figure, our Mr. Punch. As changeable and as dangerous as an away crowd on a Saturday night.</p><p>This time it was rage and petulance and resentment. I couldn&#x2019;t understand why, though&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t him who was driving out of London.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>As an institution, the BBC is just over ninety years old. Which means that Nightingale feels comfortable enough around the wireless to have a digital radio in his bathroom. On this he listens to Radio Four while he&#x2019;s shaving. Presumably he assumes that the presenters are still safely attired in evening dress while they tear strips off whatever politician has been offered up as early morning sacrifice on the <i>Today</i> program. Which is why he heard about the kids going missing before I did&#x2014;this surprised him.</p><p>&#x201c;I was under the impression you quite enjoyed the wireless first thing in the morning,&#x201d; he said over breakfast after I&#x2019;d told him it was news to me.</p><p>&#x201c;I was doing my practice,&#x201d; I said. In the weeks following the demolition of Skygarden Tower&#x2014;with me on top of it&#x2014;I&#x2019;d been a key witness in three separate investigations, in addition to one by the Department of Professional Standards. I&#x2019;d spent a great deal of each working day in interview rooms in various nicks around London including the notorious twenty-third floor of the Empress State Building where the serious investigations branch of the DPS keeps its racks and thumbscrews.</p><p>This meant that I&#x2019;d gotten into the habit of getting up early to do my practice and get in some time in the gym before heading off to answer the same bloody question five different ways. It was just as well since I hadn&#x2019;t exactly been sleeping well since Lesley had tasered me in the back. By the start of August the interviews had dried up, but the habit&#x2014;and the insomnia&#x2014;had stuck.</p><p>&#x201c;Has there been a request for assistance?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;With regard to the formal investigation, no,&#x201d; said Nightingale. &#x201c;But where children are concerned we have certain responsibilities.&#x201d;</p><p>There were two of them, both girls, both aged eleven, both missing from two separate family homes in the same village in North Herefordshire. The first 999 call had been at just after nine o&#x2019;clock the previous morning and it first hit media attention in the evening when the girls&#x2019; mobile phones were found at a local war memorial over a thousand meters from their homes. Overnight it went from local to national and, according to the <i>Today</i> program, large-scale searches were due to commence that morning.</p><p>I knew the Folly had national responsibilities in a sort of <i>de facto</i>, under the table, way that nobody liked to talk about. But I couldn&#x2019;t see how that related to missing kids.</p><p>&#x201c;Regrettably, in the past,&#x201d; said Nightingale, &#x201c;children were occasionally used in the practice of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; he groped around for the right term, &#x201c;unethical types of magic. It&#x2019;s always been our policy to keep an eye on missing child cases and, where necessary, check to make sure that certain individuals in the proximity are not involved.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Certain individuals?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Hedge wizards and the like,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>In Folly parlance a &#x201c;hedge wizard&#x201d; was any magical practitioner who had either picked up their skills <i>ad</i> <i>hoc</i> from outside the Folly or who had retired to seclusion in the countryside&#x2014;what Nightingale called &#x201c;rusticated.&#x201d; We both looked over to where Varvara Sidorovna Tamonina, formerly of the 365th Special Regiment of the Red Army, was sitting at her table on the other side of the breakfast room, drinking black coffee and reading <i>Cosmopolitan</i>. Varvara Sidorovna, trained by the Red Army, definitely fell into the &#x201c;and the like&#x201d; category. But since she&#x2019;d been lodging with us while awaiting trial for the last two months she, at least, was unlikely to be involved.</p><p>Amazingly, Varvara had appeared for breakfast before me and looking bright eyed for a woman I&#x2019;d seen put away the best part of two bottles of Stoli the night before. Me and Nightingale had been trying to get her drunk in the hope of prising more information on the Faceless Man out of her, but we got nothing except some really disgusting jokes&#x2014;many of which didn&#x2019;t translate very well. Still, the vodka had knocked me out handily and I&#x2019;d got most of a night&#x2019;s sleep.</p><p>&#x201c;So, like ViSOR,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Is that the list of sex offenders?&#x201d; asked Nightingale, who wisely never bothered to memorize an acronym until it had lasted at least ten years. I told him that it was, and he considered the question while pouring another cup of tea.</p><p>&#x201c;Better to think of ours as a register of vulnerable people,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Our task in this instance is to ensure they haven&#x2019;t become entangled in something they may later regret.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you think it&#x2019;s likely in this case?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Not terribly likely, no,&#x201d; said Nightingale. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s always better to err on the side of caution in these matters. And besides,&#x201d; he smiled, &#x201c;it will do you good to get out of the city for a couple of days.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because nothing cheers me up like a good child abduction,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Quite,&#x201d; said Nightingale.</p><p>So, after breakfast I spent an hour in the tech cave pulling background off the network and making sure my laptop was properly charged up. I&#x2019;d just requalified for my level 1 public order certificate and I threw my PSU bag into the back of the Asbo Mark 2 along with an overnight bag. I didn&#x2019;t think my flame retardant overall would be necessary, but my chunky PSU boots were a better bet than my street shoes. I&#x2019;ve been to the countryside before, and I learn from my mistakes.</p><p>I popped back to the Folly proper and met Nightingale in the main library where he handed me a manila folder tied up with faded red ribbons. Inside were about thirty pages of tissue-thin paper covered in densely typed text and what was obviously a photostat of an identity document of some sort.</p><p>&#x201c;Hugh Oswald,&#x201d; said Nightingale. &#x201c;Fought at Antwerp and Ettersberg.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He survived Ettersberg?&#x201d;</p><p>Nightingale looked away. &#x201c;He made it back to England,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But he suffered from what I&#x2019;m told is now called post-traumatic stress disorder. Still lives on a medical pension&#x2014;took up beekeeping.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How strong is he?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you wouldn&#x2019;t want to test him,&#x201d; said Nightingale. &#x201c;But I suspect he&#x2019;s out of practice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And if I suspect something?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Keep it to yourself, make a discreet withdrawal and telephone me at the first opportunity,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Before I could make it out the back door Molly came gliding out of her kitchen domain and intercepted me. She gave me a thin smile and tilted her head to one side in inquiry.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought I&#x2019;d stop on the way up,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>The pale skin between her thin black eyebrows furrowed.</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to put you to any trouble,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Molly held up an orange Sainsbury&#x2019;s bag in one long-fingered hand, I took it. It was surprisingly heavy.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s in it?&#x201d; I asked but Molly merely smiled, showing too many teeth, turned and drifted away.</p><p>I hefted the bag gingerly&#x2014;there&#x2019;d been less offal of late, but Molly could still be pretty eccentric in her culinary combinations. I made a point of stowing the bag in the shaded foot well of the backseat. Whatever was in the sandwiches, you didn&#x2019;t want them getting too warm and going off, or starting to smell, or spontaneously mutating into a new life form.</p><p>It was a brilliant London day as I set out&#x2014;the sky was blue, the tourists were blocking the pavements along the Euston Road, and the commuters panted out of their open windows and stared longingly as the fit young people strolled past in shorts and summer dresses. Pausing to tank up at a garage I know near Warwick Avenue, I tangled with the temporary one-way system around Paddington, climbed aboard the A40, bid farewell to the Art Deco magnificence of the Hoover Building and set course for what Londoners like to think of as &#x201c;everywhere else.&#x201d;</p><p>Once Mr. Punch and the M25 were behind me, I tuned the car radio to Five Live, which was doing its best to build a twenty-four-hour news cycle out of about half an hour of news. The children were still missing, the parents had made an &#x201c;emotional&#x201d; appeal and police and volunteers were searching the area.</p><p>We were barely into day two and already the radio presenters were beginning to get the desperate tone of people who were running out of questions to ask the reporters on the spot. They hadn&#x2019;t reached the <i>What do you think is going through their minds right now?</i> stage yet, but it was only a matter of time.</p><p>They were making comparisons with Soham, although nobody had been tactless enough to point out that both girls in that case had been dead even before the parents had dialed 999. Time was said to be running out, and the police and volunteers were conducting intensive search operations in the surrounding countryside. There was speculation as to whether the families would make a media appeal that evening or whether they would wait until the next day. Because this was the one area they knew anything about, they got a whole ten minutes out of discussing the family&#x2019;s media strategy before being interrupted with the news that their journalist on the spot had actually managed to interview a local. This proved to be a woman with an old-fashioned BBC accent who said naturally everyone was very shocked and that you don&#x2019;t expect that sort of thing to happen in a place like Rushpool.</p><p>The news cycle reset at the top of the hour and I learned that the tiny village of Rushpool in sleepy rural Herefordshire was the center of a massive police search operation for two eleven-year-old girls, best friends, Nicole Lacey and Hannah Marstowe, who had been missing for over forty-eight hours. Neighbors were said to be shocked and time was running out.</p><p>I turned the radio off.</p><p>Nightingale had suggested getting off at Oxford Services and going via Chipping Norton and Worcester, but I had the satnav switched to fastest route and that meant hooking round via Bromsgrove on the M42 and M5 and only bailing at Droitwich. Suddenly I was driving on a series of narrow A-roads that twisted through valleys and over gray-stone humpbacked bridges before expiring west of the River Teme. From then on it was even twistier B-roads through a country so photogenically rural that I half expected to meet Bilbo Baggins around the next corner&#x2014;providing he&#x2019;d taken to driving a Nissan Micra.</p><p>A lot of the roads had hedgerows taller than I was and thick enough to occasionally brush the side of the car. You could probably pass within half a meter of a missing child and never know she was there&#x2014;especially if she were lying still and quiet.</p><p>My satnav led me gently as lamb up through a switchback turn up onto a wooded ridge and then up a steep climb called Kill Horse Lane. At the top of a hill it guided me off the tarmac and onto an unpaved lane that took me further up the hill while taking dainty little bites out of the underside of my car. I turned around a bend to find that the lane ran past a cottage and, beyond that, a round tower&#x2014;three stories high with an oval dome roof that gave it a weirdly baroque profile. The satnav informed me that I&#x2019;d arrived at my destination, so I stopped the car and got out for a look.</p><p>The air was warm and still and smelled of chalk. The late morning sun was hot enough to create heat ripples along the dusty white track. I could hear birds squawking away in the nearby trees and a steady, rhythmic thwacking sound from just over the fence. I rolled up my sleeves and went to see what it was.</p><p>Beyond the fence the ground sloped away into a hollow where a two-story brick cottage sat among a garden laid out in an untidy patchwork of vegetable plots, miniature polytunnels, and what I took to be chicken coops, roofed over with wire mesh to keep out predators. Despite being quite a recent build there was something wonky about the line of the cottage&#x2019;s roof and the way the windows were aligned. A side door was open, revealing a hallway cluttered with muddy black wellington boots, coats and other bits of outdoor stuff. It was messy but it wasn&#x2019;t neglected.</p><p>In front of the cottage was open space where two white guys were watching a third split logs into firewood. All three were dressed in khaki shorts and naked from the waist up. One of them, an older man than the others and wearing an army green bush hat, spotted me and said something. The others turned to look, shading their eyes. The older one waved and set off up the slope of the garden toward me.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; he said. He had an Australian accent and was much older than I&#x2019;d first thought, in his sixties or possibly even older, with a lean body that appeared to be covered with wrinkled leather. I wondered if this was my guy.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for Hugh Oswald,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got the wrong house,&#x201d; said the man and nodded at the strange tower. &#x201c;He lives in that bloody thing.&#x201d;</p><p>One of the younger men strolled up to join us. Tattoos boiled up from under his shorts and ran up over his shoulders and down his arms. I&#x2019;d never seen a design like it before, interlaced vines, plants and flowers but drawn with an absolute precision&#x2014;like the nineteenth-century botanical texts I&#x2019;d seen in the Folly&#x2019;s library. They were recent enough for the red, blues and greens to still be vivid and sharp. He nodded when he reached us.</p><p>&#x201c;All right?&#x201d; he asked&#x2014;not an Aussie. His accent was English, regional, but not one I recognized.</p><p>Down by the cottage the third man hefted his ax and started whacking away again.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s here to see Oswald,&#x201d; said the older man.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; said the younger. &#x201c;Right.&#x201d;</p><p>They both had the same eyes, a pale washed-out blue like faded denim, and there were similarities in the line of the jaw and the cheekbones. Close relatives for certain&#x2014;father and son at a guess.</p><p>&#x201c;You look hot,&#x201d; said the older man. &#x201c;Do you want a glass of water or something?&#x201d;</p><p>I thanked them politely but refused.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you know if he&#x2019;s in?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>The older and younger men exchanged a look. Downslope the third man brought down his ax and&#x2014;crack&#x2014;split another log.</p><p>&#x201c;I expect so,&#x201d; said the older man. &#x201c;This time of the year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d better get on then,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Feel free to pop in on your way back,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t get that many people up here.&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled and nodded and moved on. There was even a viewing platform enclosed by rai...</p></p><h2>Dandelion Hunter: Foraging The Urban Wilderness</h2><p>When forager-journalist&nbsp;Becky Lerner sets out on a quest to find her inner hunter-gatherer in the city of Portland, Oregon, she tries to survive off wild plants from the streets and parks near her home, learns the ways of the first people who lived there and, along with a quirky cast of characters, discovers an array of useful wild plants hiding in plain sight. As she harvests herbs for food, medicine, and just-in-case apocalypse insurance, Lerner delves into anthropology, urban ecology and sustainability, and finds herself looking at&nbsp;Nature in a very different way.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Humorous, philosophical, and informative, <i>Dandelion Hunter </i>has something for everyone, from the curious neophyte to the seasoned forager.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Rebecca Lerner</b> has quickly become one of the best-known urban foragers in America. Through teaching, speaking and writing about the useful wild plants of Portland, Oregon, she seeks to "inspire and empower my fellow human beings to remember who we really are." Lerner and her popular blog, FirstWays.com, have been featured in dozens of media outlets, from national TV shows to <i>BUST</i> magazine, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>The Oregonian</i>, the <i>Boston Globe</i>, the <i>Utne Reader, </i>and much more.<i>&nbsp;</i><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Rebecca Lerner writes that &#x2018;the dirt on which we walk is made of stars.&#x2019; So are we.

You&#x2019;ll never look at weeds the same way again.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014; Brian Hiatt, senior writer, <i>Rolling Stone</i>&nbsp;</p><br>&#x201c;Rebecca Lerner proves that foraging in today's urban landscape is not only possible, but remarkably productive. In this charismatic and delightfully unpredictable book, she shares her experiences and insights in a way that touches upon the profound without being preachy.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014; Samuel Thayer, author of <i>The Forager's Harvest</i> and <i>Nature's Garden</i><br><br><p>&#x201c;Wild girl herbalist Becky Lerner plunges into the green world on page one and keeps the reader dazzled with one crazy adventure after another, all the while educating us in the art of hunting the wild dandelion.

This book relates her hunter-gatherer adventures through the streets, parks, yards, and environs of her new home in Portland, Ore., accompanied by her dog, Petunia, and a revolving cast of botanical experts and quirky friends: a wilderness survival teacher who introduces her to burdock-root and ant-egg cuisine; a &#x201c;freegan&#x201d; dumpster diver retrieving 50 pounds of gourmet ravioli and parmesan from a waste bin; an urban homesteader illegally but reverently butchering a roadkill deer....[the result] may be the funniest herbal adventure you&#x2019;ll ever read.&#x201d; &#x2014; Publishers Weekly </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p></p><h2>Out of the Vinyl Deeps: Ellen Willis on Rock Music</h2><p>In 1968, the <i>New Yorker</i> hired Ellen Willis as its first popular music critic. Her column, Rock, Etc., ran for seven years and established Willis as a leader in cultural commentary and a pioneer in the nascent and otherwise male-dominated field of rock criticism. As a writer for a magazine with a circulation of nearly half a million, Willis was also the country&#x2019;s most widely read rock critic. With a voice at once sharp, thoughtful, and ecstatic, she covered a wide range of artists&#x2014;Bob Dylan, The Who, Van Morrison, Elvis Presley, David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Joni Mitchell, the Velvet Underground, Sam and Dave, Bruce Springsteen, and Stevie Wonder&#x2014;assessing their albums and performances not only on their originality, musicianship, and cultural impact but also in terms of how they made her feel. <br>Because Willis stopped writing about music in the early 1980s&#x2014;when, she felt, rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll had lost its political edge&#x2014;her significant contribution to the history and reception of rock music has been overshadowed by contemporary music critics like Robert Christgau, Lester Bangs, and Dave Marsh. <i>Out of the Vinyl Deeps</i> collects for the first time Willis&#x2019;s Rock, Etc. columns and her other writings about popular music from this period (includingliner notes for works by Lou Reed and Janis Joplin) and reasserts her rightful place in rock music criticism. <br>More than simply setting the record straight, <i>Out of the Vinyl Deeps</i> reintroduces Willis&#x2019;s singular approach and style&#x2014;her use of music to comment on broader social and political issues, critical acuity, vivid prose, against-the-grain opinions, and distinctly female (and feminist) perspective&#x2014;to a new generation of readers. Featuring essays by the <i>New Yorker</i>&#x2019;s current popular music critic, Sasha Frere-Jones, and cultural critics Daphne Carr and Evie Nagy, this volume also provides a lively and still relevant account of rock music during, arguably, its most innovative period.</p><p>Ellen Willis (1941&#x2013;2006) was a groundbreaking radical leftist writer and thinker whose true loves were rock music, feminism, pleasure, and freedom. She was the first pop music critic for the <i>New Yorker</i> and an editor and columnist at the <i>Village Voice</i>. She wrote for numerous publications, including <i>Rolling Stone</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Nation</i>, and <i>Dissent</i>. She was the founder of the Cultural Reporting and Criticism Program at New York University, and she published three books of essays, <i>Beginning to See the Light</i>, <i>No More Nice Girls</i>, and <i>Don&#x2019;t Think, Smile!</i>Nona Willis Aronowitz has written about women, sex, music, technology, film, and youth culture for publications such as the <i>Nation</i>, the <i>New York Observer</i>, the <i>Village Voice</i>, and <i>Salon</i>. She is coauthor of <i>Girldrive: Criss-crossing America, Redefining Feminism</i>. Sasha Frere-Jones is a musician and writer from New York. He is a staff writer for the <i>New Yorker</i> and a member of the bands Ui and Calvinist. Daphne Carr lives and writes in New York City. She is editor of the Best Music Writing series. Evie Nagy is an associate editor at <i>Billboard Magazine</i>."Here, [Ellen Willis's] witty, cerebral essays finally get the compilation they deserve. She grapples with voices who inspired her . . . and relates feminism to music in revelatory ways. <i>Vinyl Deeps</i> is the testament of a crucial voice. At a time when rock clich�s were still being invented, Willis was already leaving them behind." &#x2014;Rob Sheffield, <i>Rolling Stone</i><p>"Willis's work is crystalline enough that reading each essay takes the reader on a trip back to the era when it originally appeared, but it's a testimony to her intellect and talent that those journeys look completely unlike any hagiography you might stumble across. She cuts through clich�s nimbly . . . and the essays vibrate off the page." &#x2014;<i>Village Voice</i>&nbsp;</p>"At a time when music was less understood than it is today, Willis appreciated why musicians combined passion and intellect to not only document their time, but also influence movements." &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review&nbsp;"<i>Out of the Vinyl Deeps</i> should take its place alongside Marcus&#x2019;s <i>Mystery Train</i> and Bangs&#x2019;s <i>Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung</i> as one of the canonical documents of early pop music criticism. Even with her tendency to use big words and big ideas, Willis always knew at heart that music was a gas, gas, gas. She celebrated the seriousness of pleasure and relished the pleasure of thinking seriously. She followed in the footsteps of the New Yorker critics Dorothy Parker and Pauline Kael, and elbowed her way into the men&#x2019;s club of music criticism. Maybe she didn&#x2019;t even realize it was a men&#x2019;s club&#x2014;Willis seemed fiercely independent that way. Ultimately,<i> Out of the Vinyl Deeps</i> makes you want to do what the best music criticism should: pull out a record and listen to it with new ears." &#x2014;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;"I&#x2019;d call Ellen Willis the Ida Lupino of music writing, but even that wouldn&#x2019;t say enough about this book's value. <i>Out of the Vinyl Deeps</i> is a time capsule, the publication of which invigorates and illuminates our grasp of the period it covers&#x2014;but it is also a timeless compendium of clear thinking and fresh, humane, and persuasive prose."&#x2014;Jonathan Lethem<br><br><p>"Finally, Willis&#x2019;s game-changing music writing is available in one place. It is like unearthing the holy grail of rock criticism!" &#x2014;Kathleen Hanna</p><br><br><p>"A pleasure to read and a crucial challenge when truly considered, Willis&#x2019;s essays on rock, freedom, sex, and dancing in your bedroom continue to teach me every time I return to them." &#x2014;Ann Powers</p></p><h2>A Guide to The Odyssey: A Commentary on the English Translation of Robert Fitzgerald</h2><p>For those of us who know and love the incomparable Odyssey of Homer (and there are many), Dr. Hexter has created a valuable, detailed analysis, taking into account many of Homer&#39;s most fascinating subtleties.</p><p></p><h2>Montalbano&#39;s First Case and Other Stories (An Inspector Montalbano Mystery)</h2><p><b><b><b>&#x201c;You either love Andrea Camilleri or you haven&#x2019;t read him yet.

Contemporary art has explored such diverse registers of temporality as &#39;wasting and waiting; regression and repetition; deja vu and seriality; unrealized possibility and idleness; non-consummation and counter-productivity; the belated and the premature; the disjointed and the out-of-synch - all of which go against sequentialist time and index slips in chronological experience.&#39; While theorists such as Giorgio Agamben and Mieke Bal have proposed &#39;polychronic&#39;, &#39;heterochronic&#39; or &#39;anachronic&#39; readings of history, artists have opened up the field of time to the extent that the very notion of the contemporary is brought into question.</p><p>Amelia Groom is a writer and curator who has taught at the universities of Sydney and New South Wales.

A man visits his aging father in a nursing home, where his father writes the novel he imagines his son would write. Or is it the novel that the son imagines his father would imagine, if he were to imagine the kind of novel the son would write?</p><p>Let's simplify: a woman seeks an apprenticeship with a painter, claiming to be his long-lost daughter. A contractor-for-hire named Murphy can't distinguish between the two brothers who employ him. And in Murphy's troubled dreams, Nat Turner imagines the life of William Styron. These narratives twist together with anecdotes from the nursing home, each building on the other until they crest in a wild, outlandish excursion of the inmates led by the father. Anchoring these shifting plotlines is a running commentary between father and son that sheds doubt on the truthfulness of each story.

The stockman&#x2019;s grave is a dark local landmark, the origin of urban legends, and now the site of another mysterious death. There is no detective chasing a killer in <em>The Lost Man</em>; only Nathan, the dead man&#x2019;s brother, trying to work out how his sibling ended up where and how he did. Family history plays an important role in the story: Nathan, his brother Bub, and their now-dead brother Cam were raised in a house beset by violence. Their father is deceased, but all three brothers have stayed on to work and live in the incredibly harsh surroundings. Cam was the solid one, always responsible, the brother everyone liked. So how did he, of all people, end up dead? Deceptive twists sneak up on the reader, and with <em>The Lost Man</em> Harper has crafted another slow burn mystery that catches the reader unaware right up to the surprise ending. <em>&#x2014;Seira Wilson, Amazon Book Review</em><b>Jane Harper</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Dry</i>, a #1 international bestseller, and <i>Force of Nature,</i> also an international bestseller. <i>The Lost Man</i> is her third bestselling novel.

This sweltering, run-down little theater in Basket Street used to cater to merchants of middling means with aspirations to culture, but who had neither the purse nor polish for the likes of the Tirari in the Street of Lights across the city. This place had been shuttered last he knew. The proscenium's faded paint was peeling, its gilt dull, and the footlights flickered in the draft. Only the scrim behind the stage was new, expertly painted to suggest a dark, forbidding forest.<br><br>The theater was barely large enough for a hundred people, most of them groundlings in front of the raised stage. It was nearly full, and the smell of overheated bodies was already oppressive. It was unusual for it to be this hot so early in the summer.<br><br>"Are you certain this is the right theater?" asked Duke Malthus as he handed his wife Ania, Lady Kylith, and her niece Ysmay into their chairs.<br><br>"I was just wondering the same thing myself," Seregil remarked, settling cautiously into a rickety chair between Alec and Kylith.<br><br>"Of course it is!" Kylith chuckled, tapping them both playfully with her fan.<br><br>Malthus and Kylith were considerably older than Seregil appeared, but he'd known them both in their youth. Malthus had risen to become one of the queen's senior exchequers. He had a short cropped beard but wore his grey hair to his collar--rather daring for a man in his position. Kylith, a former lover, was one of Seregil's closest friends, and an unimpeachable source of society gossip.<br><br>Seregil dabbed the sweat delicately from his upper lip with a lace-trimmed handkerchief and scanned the crowd, acknowledging those he knew--merchants and sea captains mostly--who puffed up among their friends at his notice. Even at this level of society, whom you knew, and whom you were known to know, meant a great deal. Seregil, the infamous Aurenfaie exile, had made his living playing that game in Rhiminee for a good many years now.<br><br>He and his party were certainly attracting looks and whispers. Lady Kylith's elaborately coiffed hair sparkled with jeweled pins as she murmured something to Duke Malthus. As always, she, Ania, and Ysmay were dressed in the height of summer fashion in light silks and jewels; here they looked like swans among ducks. Seregil supposed they all must. No doubt there were a few cutpurses in the audience below, sizing them up for later.<br><br>Seregil and Alec cut quite a figure themselves, two handsome, lanky young men--one dark-haired, one fair--dressed in long linen summer coats stitched in gold, fawn breeches, and well-polished boots. Seregil's long, dark brown hair was caught back with a thin red silk ribbon that matched his coat. Alec's thick blond braid hung down the back of a coat the same dark blue as his eyes.<br><br>Half-blood ya'shels like Alec aged a bit more quickly at first, but he still looked younger than his soon-to-be twenty-one. He had something of the fine 'faie features of his mother's people, and was likewise beardless, but had his human father's coloring.<br><br>Seregil played the role of a dissolute young exile that was only half true; he wasn't particularly dissolute, though he played the part well. He and Alec were well known for carousing with the young blades of the nobility and a good many not-so-young, like Kylith and Malthus. But they managed to stay just on the boundary of respectability, and when they happened to stray outside it, Seregil's distant relation to the royal family made up the difference. Handsome, foppish, and exotic, the grey-eyed 'faie was known to be somewhat well connected but of little importance.<br><br>Their true vocation would have raised more eyebrows than their dissolute ways, if it ever came to light.<br><br>"I don't suppose you've heard the latest news from the front?" asked Malthus.<br><br>Queen Phoria was still at war with the Plenimarans; the army had left winter quarters two months ago and marched north again to the battlefields of Mycena.<br><br>Malthus leaned closer to Seregil and lowered his voice. "The heralds will be announcing it tomorrow, so I suppose there's no harm in my telling you. The Overlord sued for a parlay. Phoria refused. She's sworn to drive the enemy all the way back to Benshal and crush them on their own ground."<br><br>Seregil shook his head. "She means to end the endless conflict. Do you think she can do what her mother couldn't?"<br><br>"Prince Korathan seems cautiously optimistic."<br><br>The door opened again, and Lord Nyanis and his much rowdier party spilled in and noisily ascended to the far box. He and his companions had brought several pretty courtesans from the Street of Lights as their companions, and it was evident they'd all had a lot of wine. Among them was brown-haired Myrhichia from Eirual's brothel, with whom Alec had once spent a night. Seregil was not the jealous type, particularly since he'd taken Alec there for that very purpose. She waved to them when her partner for the evening wasn't looking, and Seregil blew her a kiss. Alec shyly waved back.<br><br>Nyanis spotted them and shouted over, "We're going gambling after this. You must come with us!"<br><br>Seregil gave him a noncommittal wave.<br><br>"I haven't been to the theater in weeks. I hope these players are all you claim, my lady," Alec was saying to Kylith.<br><br>"And that we don't go home with fleas," Seregil muttered, scratching at a persistent itch in the crook of his left arm.<br><br>"Count yourselves lucky to be under a roof, my dears," Kylith replied. "Until recently, this company was performing in the streets of the Lower City. They're refugees from Mycena. They barely escaped with their lives when the Plenimaran army overran Nanta this spring."<br><br>Mycena had always been the battleground when Plenimar and Skala went to war. Those who could fled north up the Folcwine, or south to Skala. There were Mycenian enclaves up and down the northeastern shore, and quite an alarming number had found their way to Rhiminee, thinking to make their fortune here. Most were quickly disillusioned. The tenements around the Sea Market and Temple Square were crowded with families eking out a living any way they could, with the unluckiest driven into the abject poverty and degradation of the south Ring--that no-man's-land between the inner and outer city walls.<br><br>This troupe of players seemed to be among the lucky few to advance their fortunes, having attracted the attention of people like Kylith, who'd heard of them from her seamstress. Like Seregil, she never allowed rank to get in the way of anything that might prove amusing.<br><br>"What's the play called?" asked Malthus.<br><br>"The Bear King," Kylith told him. "Have you heard of it, Seregil? I never have."<br><br>"No, but I'm no expert on Mycenian theater. I have heard it can be a bit dull."<br><br>"Not this play, apparently."<br><br>Just then the sound of a drum began backstage, slow and deep as a heartbeat. An imposing, red-haired man with a long, solemn face stepped onto the stage, dressed in what appeared to be a poor approximation of ancient noble garb cobbled together from some ragman's cart. His eyes, outlined in black, seemed to look to some far-off vista as he raised a hand for silence.<br><br>"Long ago, in the time of the black ships, a caul-shrouded babe was born deep in the wilderness of the eastern mountains," he intoned, his voice deep and resonant. On the stage behind him, a girl in a tattered gown and veil writhed and cried out on the boards, then pulled a painted doll from beneath her skirts, its face covered with a veil.<br><br>"There aren't any eastern mountains in Mycena," Alec whispered.<br><br>"Dramatic license," Seregil murmured back with a smile.<br><br>The narrator continued. "And when the caul was lifted, eyes like gems of ice did steal the very breath from his mother's lips before she could give suck."<br><br>The girl expired with a groan. Someone offstage did a credible job mimicking a baby's crying. Then an older actress draped in a fusty bearskin shuffled out and gathered up the doll, rocking it in her arms.<br><br>"A she-bear found the babe and suckled it as her own until a huntsman struck her down."<br><br>An older man with grizzled grey curls leapt onstage with a crude lance and mimed running the bear through. When she expired, the man peeled the skin off her and wrapped the doll in the edge of it.<br><br>"The huntsman wrapped the child in the pelt of the she-bear that had nursed him and took him back to his wife," the narrator went on. There was no chorus, but he already had the crowd spellbound.<br><br>Despite the raggedness of his costume, the tall narrator commanded the stage as well as any player Seregil had seen at the Tirari this season.<br><br>The hunter walked around the edge of the stage, while the woman who'd played the bear took her place on the far side in a different veil and held out her arms to the child. Together the couple walked offstage.<br><br>"The baby grew to child, and child to youth, known to all as Auron the Bear's Child."<br><br>The narrator disappeared; apparently this pantomime had only been a prelude. Now the actors took over, and they were indeed very good--far too good for a place like this.<br><br>The young Auron soon revealed an unfortunate power to kill his playfellows with an angry look. At the end of the first act, ill-starred Auron reached manhood, in the form of a strikingly handsome man with wavy auburn hair.<br><br>"Well, well, who do we have here?" Kylith murmured, leaning forward for a better look at the newcomer. Her tastes ran to actors as well as officers and nobles.<br><br>Over the course of the next two acts, Auron's fortunes rose to great heights due to his dark powers and prowess with his sword. He ended up as a tyrant king, but in the end he slew his beloved and very beautiful wife and children in a fit of jealousy, turning the fatal gaze on them, then ended his own life by looking at his own image in the polished surface of a shield belonging to a younger hero--the actor who'd played the young Auron--who'd come to avenge them. Somehow, even with their ragged costumes and overlapping roles, the cast managed to maintain a veracity that impressed Seregil, who knew a thing or two about working in costume.<br><br>When it was over, people were weeping and applauding and tossing handkerchiefs and coins to the actors as they assembled to take their bows.<br><br>"I must say, I'm impressed!" said Malthus.<br><br>"Come along," Kylith said, standing and smoothing her skirts. "I want to speak with the players before that fool Nyanis gets to them."<br><br>The crowd parted for them as Kylith led the way down to the stage. Two little boys who'd played Auron's sons were still picking up the favors thrown by the crowd.<br><br>"Lady Kylith would like to speak with the master of the company," Duke Malthus told them, distributing a few coins of his own.<br><br>One of the boys made them a bobbing bow and ran backstage. A moment later the entire cast came back and bowed to them again. There were ten in all: the handsome auburn-haired lead actor, the grey-haired man and older woman, the lovely black-haired woman who'd played Auron's wife, the tall narrator, a teenage boy and girl who appeared to be twins, and three young children--two boys and a red-haired little girl--who rode on the narrator's shoulder.<br><br>Up close, their costumes looked even more threadbare, their stage paint little more than chalk and charcoal. Still, to Seregil's practiced eye, they'd made skillful use of what they had.<br><br>Kylith smiled up at the tall man. "My compliments to you and your fine company."<br><br>But it was the man who'd played Auron who bowed with an elegant gesture. His eyes were the same dark blue as Alec's. "You are most kind, gracious lady. Master Atre, lately of Nanta, at your service. May I present the company?"<br><br>"Please do!"<br><br>"This tall fellow is Brader, and this is Merina, his wife." The black-haired beauty who'd played Auron's wife curtsied to them.<br><br>"My daughter Ela," Brader told them, patting the little girl on the leg. "And those two rascals are ours, as well: Kalin and Van." The two youngest boys who'd played Auron's sons made them expert bows, with an actor's poise even at their ages. They had their mother's dark hair and eyes.<br><br>"And this is Master Zell and his wife, Mistress Leea." The old hunter and his wife bowed. "They are Merina's parents and actors of great renown in Mycena. Our twins complete our little company: Teibo and Tanni." The boy had played both young Auron and the young hero who'd killed Atre at the end of the play. Tanni had been Auron's mother. Both were lithe and shared the same high cheekbones and brown hair and eyes.<br><br>Seregil made the introductions for his friends.<br><br>Atre's eyes widened. "We are honored to have such nobles attend our humble performance! I must apologize for our lowly state and poor showing."<br><br>"You're far too modest," said Seregil. Behind the man's fawning smile he sensed a sharp mind already wondering how to best capitalize on this bit of luck.<br><br>"It pains me to see great talent in such poor estate." Taking out her silk purse, Kylith gave it to the actor unopened and Seregil heard the mellow clink of gold. She gave Merina a ring from her finger and a kiss, then turned to the rest of her friends. "Come along now, talent must be rewarded! You, too, Nyanis." She waved over the other lord and his guests.<br><br>Seregil and the others could hardly refuse, and Brader and his wife had to help collect the money--quite a bit of it gold.<br><br>"And how did you fare in Nanta, Master Atre?" she asked. "I suppose you had your own theater?"<br><br>"We did, my lady, until the soldiers burned it to the ground. As you can see, we lost everything. Four of our players were killed. The rest of us barely escaped."<br><br>"I hope our contributions tonight help you. I look forward to seeing more of your performances."<br><br>Atre took her proffered hand and kissed it reverently. "You will always have a place of honor in our theater, my lady."<br>"That was a more expensive evening than I'd anticipated," Seregil murmured, pretending to be piqued as they took their leave of Malthus and his wife, and followed Kylith and Ysmay out to find their carriage. "I think, between us, we gave him enough to buy the wretched place."<br><br>"You can certainly afford it," Kylith said with a laugh. "And admit it, you were transfixed."<br><br>"They were very good," said Alec.</p><h2>Embracing Exile: Living Faithfully as God&#39;s Unique People in the World</h2><p>Exile can be a frightening prospect.Like the Israelites in Babylon, Christians today may feel they are in unfamiliar territory, surrounded by a culture with customs and practices foreign to their faith.

A rigorous examination of the state of our knowledge of the world following these developments is undertaken with this guiding principle: that although further scientific thought may take us far beyond our present conception of the world, we may never again return to the previous narrow and restricted scheme.<br>Although a degree of mathematical sophistication is presupposed, Dr. Weyl develops all the tensor calculus necessary to his exposition. He then proceeds to an analysis of the concept of Euclidean space and the spatial conceptions of Riemann. From this the nature of the amalgamation of space and time is derived. This leads to an exposition and examination of Einstein's general theory of relativity and the concomitant theory of gravitation. A detailed investigation follows devoted to gravitational waves, a rigorous solution of the problem of one body, laws of conservation, and the energy of gravitation. Dr. Weyl's introduction of the concept of tensor-density as a magnitude of quantity (contrasted with tensors which are considered to be magnitudes of intensity) is a major step toward a clearer understanding of the relationships among space, time, and matter.</p><p>Along with his fundamental contributions to most branches of mathematics, Hermann Weyl (1885-1955) took a serious interest in theoretical physics. In addition to teaching in Z�rich, G�ttingen, and Princeton, Weyl worked with Einstein on relativity theory at the Institute for Advanced Studies. <p><b>Hermann Weyl: The Search for Beautiful Truths <br></b>One of the most influential mathematicians of the twentieth century, Hermann Weyl (1885&#x2013;1955) was associated with three major institutions during his working years: the ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), the University of Gottingen, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In the last decade of Weyl's life (he died in Princeton in 1955), Dover reprinted two of his major works, <i>The Theory of Groups and Quantum Mechanics</i> and <i>Space, Time, Matter</i>. Two others, <i>The Continuum</i> and <i>The Concept of a Riemann Surface</i> were added to the Dover list in recent years. </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>In the Author's Own Words:<br></b>"My work always tried to unite the truth with the beautiful, but when I had to choose one or the other, I usually chose the beautiful." </p><p> </p><p>"We are not very pleased when we are forced to accept mathematical truth by virtue of a complicated chain of formal conclusions and computations, which we traverse blindly, link by link, feeling our way by touch.

The figures of speech should not be learned the same way as the periodic table of elements. This is because figures of speech are not about hypothetical structures in things, but about real potentialities within language and within ourselves. The "figurings" of speech reveal the apparently limitless plasticity of language itself. We are inescapably confronted with the intoxicating possibility that we can make language do for us almost anything we want. Or at least a Shakespeare can. The figures of speech help to see how he does it, and how we might. <br> <br> Therefore, in the chapters presented in this volume, the quotations from Shakespeare, the Bible, and other sources are not presented to exemplify the definitions. Rather, the definitions are presented to lead to the quotations. And the quotations are there to show us how to do with language what we have not done before. They are there for imitation.<br></p><p></p><h2>Murach&#39;s JavaScript and jQuery (3rd Edition)</h2><p><p>Today, you'll find JavaScript and jQuery used everywhere on the web, from small individual sites to the largest commercial sites like Google, Amazon, and Facebook.

Nixon: The American Presidents Series: The 37th President, 1969-1974</h2><p><p><b>The complex man at the center of America's most self-destructive presidency</b></p><p>In this provocative and revelatory assessment of the only president ever forced out of office, the legendary Washington journalist Elizabeth Drew explains how Richard M. Nixon's troubled inner life offers the key to understanding his presidency. She shows how Nixon was surprisingly indecisive on domestic issues and often wasn't interested in them. Turning to international affairs, she reveals the inner workings of Nixon's complex relationship with Henry Kissinger, and their mutual rivalry and distrust. The Watergate scandal that ended his presidency was at once an overreach of executive power and the inevitable result of his paranoia and passion for vengeance. </p><p>Even Nixon's post-presidential rehabilitation was motivated by a consuming desire for respectability, and he succeeded through his remarkable resilience. Through this book we finally understand this complicated man. While giving him credit for his achievements, Drew questions whether such a man&#x2015;beleaguered, suspicious, and motivated by resentment and paranoia&#x2015;was fit to hold America's highest office, and raises large doubts that he was.</p></p><p><p><b>Elizabeth Drew</b> is the award-winning author of thirteen previous books, including <i>Washington Journal</i>, <i>Politics and Money</i>, <i>Whatever It Takes: The Real Struggle for Political Power in America</i>, and <i>The Corruption of American Politics</i>.

She lives and works in Washington, D.C.</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>Richard Milhous Nixon was an improbable president. He didn&#x2019;t particularly like people. He lacked charm or humor or joy. Socially awkward and an introvert, he had few friends and was virtually incapable of small talk. He didn&#x2019;t care to, in his words, press the flesh. He was also one of our most complex presidents: insecure, self-pitying, vindictive, suspicious&#x2014;even literally paranoid&#x2014;and filled with long-nursed anger and resentments, which burst forth from time to time. He never seemed the happy warrior.<br><br>Even reaching the pinnacle of American politics didn&#x2019;t satisfy him. The mixing of his psyche with the presidency made for a poisonous brew, with tragic consequences, as he became the first president to be driven from office. Strikingly, and openly, self-preoccupied, Nixon often talked or wrote about his inner feelings, sometimes with startling self-knowledge. Nixon&#x2019;s first book was titled Six Crises, about what he saw as his own ordeals. During his presidency he referred to it often, urging people to read it.<br><br>The historian David Greenberg has written that Nixon&#x2019;s unusual personality unleashed an unprecedented national seminar on the hidden workings of the incumbent president&#x2019;s mind. Even Henry Kissinger, Nixon&#x2019;s national security adviser and later secretary of state, remarked, Can you imagine what this man would have been if someone loved him?1 Nixon was our most Shakespearean president; he brought us into his tragedy and made us go through it with him. He was the second president (but not the last) to face impeachment proceedings, though the proceedings against him were the most serious and least partisan. He was forced to resign his office before the full House of Representatives could vote on the articles of impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee, or the Senate could vote to convict him. By that time, he had no choice.<br><br>But Nixon was much more than the cartoon figure with the perpetual five o&#x2019;clock shadow, his arms extended upward, his fingers forming a V. He accomplished a great deal more than is usually granted him&#x2014;in large part because it&#x2019;s difficult not to view his presidency through the prism of Watergate and impeachment.<br><br>He has come to be widely considered our last progressive Republican president, picking up where William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt left off. But his apparent progressiveness was so mixed with pragmatism and not a little cynicism, and so rooted in the politics of his time, and his interest in domestic policy was so limited, that there is reason to question whether he was a true believer in progressive policies and whether he would have held to them in a later, more conservative, Republican age. Even as he ran for the presidency in 1968, Nixon set in motion the turn of the Republican Party to the right. His foreign policy was marked by highs and lows.<br><br>For all his self-pity, Nixon was amazingly resilient to the end, not only surviving his defeats&#x2014;which were of a magnitude that would have broken other figures&#x2014;but coming back and back, creating his own restorations, repeatedly presenting the public with a New Nixon. Yet while he convinced some pundits and others that there really was a New Nixon, and he maintained a following until nearly the end, he also aroused unusually strong hatred among the American public&#x2014;a hatred that has lingered long after his death.<br><br>How did such a peculiar man become president, and win reelection? In part it was that resilience, and also his fierce and dogged determination. Nixon displayed extraordinary grit; he was unusually willing to do the scut work of politics; he knew the country district by district, doing favors for myriad other politicians, expecting their support in return. Moreover, he was an exceptionally smart man, with a solid command of wide-ranging information, and an able politician. He was a product of his times as well as the pioneer of the rough political tactics for which he became famous&#x2014;and loathed. Also, in light of what came later, it&#x2019;s important to recall that when Dwight D. Eisenhower selected him as his running mate in 1952, Nixon was a hero to a large swath of the American public, a star of the Republican Party. After that, he benefited from the Republican Party&#x2019;s traditional respect for hierarchy and its tendency to select tested warhorses. And, as in the case of many successful politicians, there was an element of luck in his triumph. Many observers believed that had Lyndon B. Johnson imposed a bombing pause in Vietnam a week earlier than he did at the end of October 1968, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, who was rapidly gaining on Nixon, might well have won that election. He also benefited by the selection in 1972, at a time when the social upheavals caused by the Vietnam War were at a peak, of George McGovern, the favorite of the antiwar left of the Democratic Party, at a raucous convention. McGovern went on to have a string of bad luck himself.<br>As a journalist in Washington I covered the Nixon presidency, and I wrote a book about the extraordinary period called Watergate. Nixon&#x2019;s tumultuous presidency was for those of us who lived through it the most riveting of our lifetimes and, perhaps, in all of American history. Those who went through that time with him are left with vivid memories: Nixon standing behind the podium at a press conference in the East Room of the White House as the Watergate scandal began to unfold, his hips swiveling as if within a hula hoop; Nixon telling the nation, I am not a crook; Nixon playing with a yo-yo on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry; Nixon&#x2019;s tearful farewell speech to his staff. And then the final overhead Vs as he boarded the helicopter to return to California. It has been said that Nixon&#x2019;s was a criminal presidency, but that misses the larger point. He put the nation through an unprecedented constitutional crisis, during which for a long while it wasn&#x2019;t clear that our system of government would hold. It was a frightening time.<br><br>But his presidency was much more as well.<br><br>Copyright � 2007 by Elizabeth Drew.

He discusses the nature and character of the law as revealed in Deuteronomy, as well as the nature of the moral life under God.

The effects upon hundreds of thousands of these recipients have been researched. The results are in: skills acquisition and use are spectacularly powerful. This book explains the essential interpersonal skills needed by professional and lay counselors, teachers, business managers, parents, everyone.</p><p>Dr. Robert R. Carkhuff believes that all human growth and development begins with relating. Dr. Carkhuff considers himself fortunate to have begun his own career in helping and human relations. He was the first to define the interpersonal core of all helping and human relationships in operational, and therefore achievable, terms. The so-called Carkhuff model is specifically the source of all current systematic approaches to interpersonal relating and, indeed, is generally the source of human resource development approaches. Indeed, it is precisely this theme of Human Development that defines Carkhuff s lifework. It begins with the most profound step: relating interpersonally. It culminates in a series of spiraling explosions: empowering people to actu alize their own human potential. It is in the context of this ongoing work that this ninth edition of The Art of Helping is presented!</p><h2>Rotten Teeth</h2><p>Speaking in front of the class isn&#39;t easy for small people like Melissa Herman. Especially when there&#39;s nothing very special to say about her house or her family or herself. But with the help of her older brother, Melissa borrows a bottle from her father&#39;s dental office to take to show and tell. The teacher is appalled, but the children are intrigued. David Catrow&#39;s hilariously zany illustrations reveal that there is nothing ordinary about Melissa Herman, or her house or her family. The bright artwork is laugh-aloud funny and will have children begging to hear the story again, or maybe invent their very own tale.</p><p>Laura Simms really did bring a bottle of rotten teeth to school for show and tell. And she really did discover she could tell good stories. Now an internationally known storyteller, she has performed and taught in major festivals, symposiums, and conferences around the world. She started the first storytelling programs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, and the American Museum of Natural History. When she isn&#x2019;t touring the country telling stories, she lives in New York City.<br><br>David Catrow is an editorial cartoonist and the illustrator of more than&nbsp;seventy books for children, including the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>I Ain't Gonna Paint No More!</i> and <i>I Like Myself!, </i>both written by Karen Beaumont, <i>Dozens of Cousins </i>by Shutta Crum, <i>Plantzilla</i> by Jerdine Nolen, and <i>Rotten Teeth </i>by Laura Simms. He lives in Ohio. Visit his website at www.catrow.com.First-grader Melissa Hermann needs something for show and tell. In her dentist dad's office, with the help of her brother Norman she finds a bottle full of pulled teeth. Melissa carefully washes enough teeth to give one to every member of her class, then disguises the bottle in a brown bag. In a suspenseful scene?rendered even more dramatic by a worm's-eye view of desks and gaping students?Melissa slinks to the front of the classroom with her prize and stands there nervously. "Finally she opened up the bag, held up the bottle, and blurted out, 'ROTTEN TEETH! FROM REAL MOUTHS!' " With just a dash of hyperbole, Simms (The Bone Man) explains how the teeth horrify Melissa's teacher but enhance the girl's popularity among her peers. At recess, Melissa captivates her audience with gruesome tales of dentistry and learns the power of storytelling. If Simms's intent is to banish shyness, Catrow's (Westward Ho, Carlotta!) goal is to catapult a humorous story into the realm of the tall tale. He boosts the irony by providing Melissa with ample show-and-tell oddities; her home not only houses a dentist's office but is a Victorian curiosity shop of bizarre decorations (a boar's head, a prehistoric skull) and living oddities (a monkey, an elephant, a Venus flytrap). Catrow tints his over-the-top watercolor illustrations with dental-decay-inspired yellows and greens, and he dresses his gawky, frizzy-haired characters in ridiculously mismatched clothes. This not-for-the-squeamish volume should impress future fans of Southern gothic.

Churchill tried to keep himself afloat by borrowing to the hilt, putting off bills, and writing "all over the place"; when all else failed, he had to ask family or friends to come to the rescue. Yet within five years of the war, he had taken advantage of his worldwide celebrity to transform his private fortunes with the same ruthlessness as he waged war, reaching 1945 with today's equivalent of �3 million in the bank. His lucrative war memoirs were still to come.</p><p>Throughout the story, Lough highlights the threads of risk, energy, persuasion, and sheer willpower to survive that link Churchill's private and public lives. He shows how constant money pressures often tempted him to short-circuit the ethical standards expected of public figures in his day before usually pulling back to put duty first-except where the taxman was involved.</p></p><p><b>David Lough </b>studied history at Oxford under Richard Cobb and Theodore Zeldin.

In desperation, the Rough Riders were born. A unique group of volunteers, ranging from Ivy League athletes to Arizona cowboys and led by Theodore Roosevelt, they helped secure victory in Cuba in a series of gripping, bloody fights across the island. Roosevelt called their charge in the Battle of San Juan Hill his &#x201c;crowded hour&#x201d;&#x2014;a turning point in his life, one that led directly to the White House. &#x201c;The instant I received the order,&#x201d; wrote Roosevelt, &#x201c;I sprang on my horse and then my &#x2018;crowded hour&#x2019; began.&#x201d; As <i>The Crowded Hour</i> reveals, it was a turning point for America as well, uniting the country and ushering in a new era of global power.<br> <br> Both a portrait of these men, few of whom were traditional soldiers, and of the Spanish-American War itself, <i>The Crowded Hour </i>dives deep into the daily lives and struggles of Roosevelt and his regiment. Using diaries, letters, and memoirs, Risen illuminates a disproportionately influential moment in American history: a war of only six months&#x2019; time that dramatically altered the United States&#x2019; standing in the world.

Long, the secretary of the navy, was sitting in his office in the State, War and Navy Building, a Second Empire jumble of columns and mansard roofs next to the Executive Mansion that Mark Twain had called the ugliest edifice in America. Long, fifty-nine, was a stoop-shouldered, gently cerebral former governor of Massachusetts whom President William McKinley had called out of private legal practice in Hingham, a coastal town south of Boston, to serve in his cabinet. He was an able administrator and politician, but he was happiest writing poetry and reading Latin; one of his proudest achievements was publishing a verse translation of The Aeneid.1<br> <br>Long was, in other words, the exact opposite of Theodore Roosevelt, his assistant secretary, who at that minute burst into his boss&#x2019;s morning reverie. Roosevelt shut the door and, Long recalled, &#x201c;Began in his usual emphatic and dead-in-earnest manner&#x201d; to run through his latest efforts on the part of the department. Then, his face reddening, Roosevelt turned to Cuba, along with Puerto Rico the last remnant of the once vast Spanish Empire in the Western Hemisphere, and his certainty that Spain and the United States would soon come to blows over the island&#x2019;s struggle for independence. &#x201c;He told me that, in case of war with Spain, he intends to abandon everything and go to the front,&#x201d; Long wrote.2<br> <br>The cause of Roosevelt&#x2019;s eruption that day was an anti-American riot in Havana on January 12. The McKinley administration was putting diplomatic pressure on Spain to reach an end to its war in Cuba; after rumors reached Havana that the government in Madrid had finally agreed to Washington&#x2019;s demands, Spanish loyalists and soldiers had rampaged across the center of the island&#x2019;s capital, attacking newspaper offices and the American consulate. Fitzhugh Lee, the consul general in Havana, cabled Washington with the news: While there was little damage to American property, the violence bode poorly for any hope of a negotiated settlement to the nearly three-year war, which had decimated the Cuban economy and killed well over 100,000 civilians, along with tens of thousands of Spanish soldiers and Cuban rebels.3<br> <br>Long kept quiet as his assistant seethed. One didn&#x2019;t just listen to Roosevelt; one felt him. He seemed to have no inside voice. He expounded grandiloquently before crowds as small as one, in forums as intimate as the office of the secretary of the navy. He had a slightly high pitch to his voice and he spoke in rapid spurts, with long vowels and chopped-off consonants. He boomed, he hissed, he spat out words&#x2014;&#x201c;bully!,&#x201d; &#x201c;delighted!&#x201d;&#x2014;like a Gatling gun. And he didn&#x2019;t speak merely with his mouth: His whole body shook in rhythm, his fists banging into his palms to drive home a point. But while he was often full of bluster, it wasn&#x2019;t hot air. Roosevelt was widely regarded as one of the most intelligent, well-read people in Washington, with a steel-trap of a mind and an ability to recall minor facts consumed years before. Even his detractors found Roosevelt&#x2019;s extemporaneous orations a thing to behold: He could speak off the cuff about everything from New England wildlife to German politics, whatever fit the moment.4<br> <br>Still, it could be a lot to take in, and those who tolerated Roosevelt usually did so with resignation, rarely with enthusiasm. In the months since they had joined the department together, Long had learned to manage Roosevelt&#x2019;s energies, a full-time job in itself. When he wasn&#x2019;t preparing for war with Cuba, Roosevelt was ordering up new warships, or restructuring the department&#x2019;s procurement policy, or investigating mismanagement at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. &#x201c;He bores me with plans of naval and military movement,&#x201d; Long wrote in his journal the night after Roosevelt barged into his office. &#x201c;By tomorrow morning, he will have got half a dozen heads of bureaus together and have spoiled twenty pages of good writing paper, and lain awake half the night.&#x201d;5<br> <br>Roosevelt had been thrust upon Long by President McKinley, and he in turn had been thrust upon McKinley by New York politics and Roosevelt&#x2019;s close friend Henry Cabot Lodge, a Republican senator from Massachusetts. Long appreciated Roosevelt for his energy, but he would have much preferred a quietly competent career naval officer as his second. Unlike Roosevelt, Long did not think war was coming. If anything, he was naive about the situation in Cuba and Spain&#x2019;s desire and ability to improve it. &#x201c;My own notion is that Spain is not only doing the best it can, but is going very well in its present treatment of the island,&#x201d; Long wrote in his diary. &#x201c;Our government certainly has nothing to complain of.&#x201d;6<br> <br>More than temperament divided the two men. They came from different generations&#x2014;both born on October 27, Long was exactly twenty years older than Roosevelt&#x2014;and had vastly different ideas about America and its place in the world. Long&#x2019;s generation was both scarred and motivated by the experience of the Civil War; they knew what war was, and they believed that their achievements since&#x2014;social stability, economic growth, industrialization, and the closing of the Western frontier&#x2014;had made large-scale conflict unnecessary, at least as far as the United States was concerned. Minor wars might embroil Europe, but Europe was far away. Wise, sustained growth and a restrained, conservative foreign policy, the hallmarks of the Republican Party and its domination of national politics in the late nineteenth century, would ensure that America would never again face the horrors of war, domestic or otherwise. With no small amount of self-awareness, Long called a published edition of his diary America of Yesterday.<br> <br>Roosevelt stood out even among his generation in taking exception to Long&#x2019;s vision of the world. He had grown up in the shadow of the Civil War and its veterans; he admired (and envied) their experience, but also questioned why, after such a searing war, they should be so afraid of another one that they refused even to prepare for it&#x2014;an error that, Roosevelt believed, made another war more likely. Even more, it was America&#x2019;s responsibility, to its own interests as well as the world&#x2019;s, to use its growing power to shape foreign affairs. In his own autobiography, Roosevelt called the chapter on the Spanish-American War &#x201c;The War of America the Unready.&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Born in Manhattan in 1858 and called Teedie by his family, Roosevelt later described himself as a scrawny, sickly child, hindered by asthma and poor eyesight&#x2014;&#x201c;a great little home-boy,&#x201d; his sister Bamie said. To make up for his self-perceived deficiencies, he spent long hours as a boy exercising, hiking, and swimming. He kept daily records of his physical activity and subsequent gains in strength, weight, and stamina. He worked out alone when necessary, but he liked a partner because he favored violent sports, especially boxing. His love for the pugilistic arts continued long after he reached maturity, even after he returned from Cuba&#x2014;as governor of New York, he had a ring installed in his mansion in Albany.7<br> <br>Whatever physical ailments Roosevelt suffered, his greatest debilitation was his hero worship of his father, Theodore Roosevelt Sr. &#x201c;My father was the best man I ever knew,&#x201d; Theodore Junior said. In letters and diary entries, he called his father &#x201c;Greatheart,&#x201d; after the heroic giant-slayer in John Bunyan&#x2019;s The Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress. Theodore Senior was born into wealth and proved a proficient if sometimes distracted businessman; he engaged with politics but resisted the opportunities that America&#x2019;s unbound postwar corruption offered. He cofounded New York institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History. But he had also avoided service during the Civil War by hiring someone to go in his place&#x2014;a legal, not uncommon avenue for wealthy Americans to get out of their martial obligations, but one that his son could never quite square with his faith in his father&#x2019;s courage. Nor was his father able to give him the paternal support his son needed; Roosevelt Senior loved his family deeply, but was also often absent from it, away on business. And then he died, of stomach cancer, when his Teedie was nineteen and a sophomore at Harvard. What this all amounted to, in the figure of Theodore Junior, was a man who burst with energy and intelligence, came from sufficient wealth to give him room to exploit his gifts, and carried an enormous chip on his shoulder. A man who had nothing to prove seemed to believe that he had everything to prove.<br> <br>While still a teenager, Roosevelt climbed mountains in Maine and Switzerland, Germany and upstate New York. He taught himself taxidermy, and practiced it avidly, frequently emerging from his room covered in the blood of some animal he had killed on a weekend hunting trip. At Harvard he lifted himself from a middling B average as a freshman to Phi Beta Kappa; he was invited to join the Porcellian Club, the most exclusive undergraduate social organization on campus; and on the side wrote a book, The Naval War of 1812, that remained a standard text in college classrooms for decades. Along the way, he built himself from being &#x201c;a youth in the kindergarten stage of physical development,&#x201d; as one classmate recalled, into a physical brute, strutting about the Yard, often shirtless, with gnarly muttonchops bewhiskering his cheeks. He once rowed from Long Island to Connecticut, alone, in a single day, a full twenty-five miles. Some of the stories told about Roosevelt as a Harvard man later proved apocryphal, but like so much in his life, their veracity is beside the point: The myth is inextricable from the man. Roosevelt also developed a reputation as an ill-tempered, prudish elitist&#x2014;uninterested in anyone not of the &#x201c;gentleman-sort&#x201d;&#x2014;and as a result had few friends around Cambridge. In fact, what he disdained were the leisure classes. He admired those whom he judged, fairly or not, to come from hearty, hardy New England stock, whether they had used their brains and brawn to build wealth or simply earn a good day&#x2019;s pay. He had no time for those who took to the lighter side of life, who accepted the &#x201c;gentleman&#x2019;s C,&#x201d; at Harvard or later as adults.8<br> <br>As he neared the end of his studies, Roosevelt wasn&#x2019;t sure where to go next. Looking back, his career from graduation to inauguration as president&#x2014;spanning just twenty-one years&#x2014;seems to follow a straight line from achievement to achievement, from strength to strength. But in fact he often felt undirected and unwilling to commit to one single endeavor. He inherited a small fortune from his father, paying about $8,000 a year (a little under $200,000 in 2018), which allowed him to live comfortably without having to work for an income. His real love was science, especially what would later be called evolutionary biology, but was put off by the fact that serious graduate work, at the time, meant years studying in Germany, home to the world&#x2019;s best research institutions.9<br> <br>Lacking a specific direction, Roosevelt went to law school, at Columbia. But he had already fallen into local politics, and left school in 1881 without graduating to run for, and win, election to the New York State Assembly. He proved an able and energetic politician, committed to the Republican Party but also willing to buck against its establishment in pushing reform bills. He led an anticorruption campaign against the railroad tycoon Jay Gould, and another campaign to ban the home manufacture of cigars. In all this he made no shortage of enemies, who called the twenty-three-year-old legislator &#x201c;Young Squirt,&#x201d; &#x201c;Weakling,&#x201d; and, most colorfully, &#x201c;Jane-Daddy.&#x201d; Two years later, just as his political career was taking off, Roosevelt&#x2019;s wife, Alice, died from Bright&#x2019;s disease (kidney inflammation) soon after she had given birth to their daughter, and on the same day that his mother passed away, in the same house. Though he rarely spoke about his first wife again, Roosevelt was devastated. A few months afterward (and following the 1884 Republican National Convention in Chicago, where he tried, and failed, to block the nomination of James G. Blaine) he left political life and his daughter behind and moved to the Dakota Territory, where he intended to become a cattle rancher.10<br> <br>Roosevelt had already spent time in the Dakotas, hunting deer and bison along the Little Missouri River. It was more than a hobby; his connection to the West was part of his self-identity: Almost immediately and for the rest of his life, he liked to tell crowds that he was &#x201c;at heart as much a Westerner as an Easterner.&#x201d; Still, when he arrived in the town of Medora, near his new ranchstead, he was greeted skeptically, even derisively, on account of his thick glasses and unsullied clothing. He was, by appearance, a dude. As a group of cowhands watched, he dismounted and walked into the town&#x2019;s general store. While he was inside one of the men switched his saddle and bridle to a similar-looking, but very wild, bronco they called White-Faced Kid. Roosevelt came out of the store, mounted the horse&#x2014;and the animal bucked him straight in the air.<br> <br>The shopkeeper, Joe Ferris, came running out. &#x201c;Are you hurt?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not a bit,&#x201d; said Roosevelt. He remounted the horse, and once again went skyward.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s too bad I broke my glasses&#x201d; was all he said, and he went inside for a new pair. And once again, he got back on the horse, who this time went flying off down the street with Roosevelt still in the saddle, dust clouds whirling behind them. The crowd grew worried; someone went looking for a doctor. But after a few minutes Roosevelt returned, shouting and grinning and trotting along on White-Faced Kid. &#x201c;We took a shine to him from that very day,&#x201d; recalled one of the ranch hands, Fred Herrig, who years later would join Roosevelt as a Rough Rider in Cuba. &#x201c;Any fellow who could ride White-Faced Kid at one trial and holler like that was the man for our money; except that we didn&#x2019;t have any money, until we&#x2019;d hired out to Roosevelt.&#x201d;11<br> <br>Despite his dramatic entrance, ranching proved one of the few failures of Roosevelt&#x2019;s life. He simply couldn&#x2019;t commit to the unending demands that came with being a cattle baron. He frequently returned to New York to see his daughter and keep his hand in state politics. On those trips he also began to court a childhood sweetheart, Edith Carow; the two were married in 1886. After a blizzard killed off most of his cattle, he conceded that one could not be a part-time rancher, like one could be a gentleman farmer back East, and sold his stock and property for a loss. It was inevitable, blizzard or not&#x2014;his life was on the East Coast. In 1887 Edith gave birth to their first of five children, Theodore III (later known as &#x201c;Junior,&#x201d; despite being third in the line), and Roosevelt began building a sprawling house for his new family in the village of Oyster Bay, on the North Shore of Long Island. He called his home Sagamore Hil...</p><h2>Picking Cotton: Our Memoir of Injustice and Redemption</h2><p><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> best selling true story of an unlikely friendship forged between a woman and the man she incorrectly identified as her rapist and sent to prison for 11 years.</b></p><p>Jennifer Thompson was raped at knifepoint by a man who broke into her apartment while she slept.

He&#x2019;s got to lean waay down to hug Jennifer, a tiny blonde with bobbed hair.

Her brown ponytail bopping behind her, she keeps her cleats close to the ball, switch- backing across the field to try to keep it away from the other side until she&#x2019;s got a clear path to pass it to her fellow players. When she sees her opening, Brittany makes a strong, sure kick and sends the ball to her teammate, who takes off for the goal. The crowd yells for the black and white ball to make it into the net as if nothing could matter more.</p><p>The Reds, Brittany&#x2019;s team, win the first game of the tournament, and then they break for lunch. Brittany, spotting Ron and Raven with her mom, jogs over and hugs them both, happy they are there. The four of them head over with the other parents to the park&#x2019;s pavilion. With his Burger King bags picked up from the drive- in, Ron isn&#x2019;t part of the usual soccer parent crowd: moms like Jennifer who unpack neatly prepared sandwiches and snacks from Tupperware and coolers. After the kids eat, Brittany heads off to the grass to show Raven how to kick straight and dribble, while Jennifer and Ron catch up. One nosy mom can&#x2019;t resist and comes over to say hello.</p><p>&#x201c;Jennifer, Brittany was just great today!&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Too bad your husband missed it.

To Detective Inspector Irene Huss&#x2019;s surprise, her boss takes the<br>complaint seriously, even bringing her with him to a remote cottage in southern Sweden to investigate. There they discover the body of the teacher in question, victim of a rifle shot to the head. When they visit his parents to break the news, they find the couple dead in their bed, each shot between the eyes. The family&#x2019;s sole surviving member, their daughter in London, is too grief-stricken for questioning. A swath of suspects arises as Irene investigates, but she has a hunch the answers to this case lie in England.</p><p>Helene Tursten was a nurse and a dentist before she turned to writing. Other books in the Irene Huss series include <i>Detective Inspector Huss</i>, <i>Night Rounds</i>,<i> The Torso</i>, <i>The Golden Calf</i>, <i>The Fire Dance</i>, <i>The Beige Man</i>, and <i>The Treacherous Net</i>. Her books have been translated into 18 languages. She was born in G�teborg, Sweden, where she now lives with her husband and daughter.The third Irene Huss mystery to appear in the U.S. is considerably less gritty than either detective <i>Inspector Huss</i>(2003) or <i>The Torso</i>(2006), but it continues Tursten's sensitive exploration of how a female detective manages to balance family life with police work: not only the time pressures but also the jarring psychological disconnects that occur when jumping between dramatically different worlds. This time Huss' case--the execution-style murders of a minister, his wife, and their schoolteacher son--takes the Swedish detective from the scene of the crime, a village outside Goteborg, to London, where the traumatized daughter of the minister lives. Road-trip mysteries inevitably sacrifice the signature landscape that is often key to the series' appeal, but in this case, the fact that Huss is on her own in London gives Tursten the opportunity to probe deeper into her heroine's character. The plot itself is less compelling than the previous two entries in the series--the shocking climax will be guessed early on--but Huss is quickly becoming one of the most satisfying lead characters in the thriving world of Swedish crime fiction. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A 19-year-old student sent Rilke some of his verses, seeking an opinion of their worth. Rilke declined to offer a critique, instead encouraging the student to rely upon his own inner judgment: "Nobody can advise and help you, nobody. There is only one single means. Go inside yourself."<br> This seemingly dismissive letter proved to be the first of ten, written during a six-year period that coincided with an important stage in Rilke's artistic development. The poet offered his young correspondent further advice on developing a rich inner life as well as guidance on broader philosophical and existential issues. These letters, which explore many of the themes that later emerged in Rilke's best works, remain a captivating source of insights into the artistic identity and process.</p><p>Although his poetry was recognized and admired by leading European artists, Austro-German poet Rainer Maria Rilke (1875&#x2013;1926) was virtually unknown during his lifetime. He achieved international acclaim with his last two works, <i>Duino Elegies</i> and <i>Sonnets to Orpheus,</i> and he has come to be recognized as a master of verse.</p><h2>With Love and Prayers: A Headmaster Speaks to the Next Generation</h2><p>Here, at last is a book of "uncommon common sense" for young people by someone who has worked with them for thirty-five years. F. Washington Jarvis is one of the nation s most eminent educators, now in his twenty-eighth year as headmaster of Boston's Roxbury Latin School, the oldest school in continuous operation in North America.<br><br>Jarvis s approach is anecdotal. "If it is true that a picture is worth a thousand words, it is ten times as true when you are speaking to young teenagers. They are gripped by the story of how real people cope with real situations. They are interested when you share with them the concrete realities of your own life and experience, and they are almost always willing to listen to adults who actually believe in something, who actually stand for something."<br><br>Jarvis's addresses, reprinted from his school's publications, have enjoyed something of a cult "underground" circulation among young people - and their parents and grandparents. Now his "top hits" have been brought together in a single volume for wider circulation.<br><br>The author never talks down to his audience. He knows that - appearances to the contrary - students are asking the deepest questions, questions about whether life has meaning and purpose. He also knows that teenagers often find themselves caught by surprise in situations where they have to make tough decisions. And he believes that they are willing, even eager, to know how others have coped in similar situations.<br><br>This is a book of deep and practical wisdom, one of our surprise "bestsellers" in hardcover, and now available in softcover to serve an even wider audience.<br><br>Winner of the 2001 Christopher Award</p><p></p><h2>Mcgraw Hill Reading: Wonders, Your Turn Practice Book, Grade 4</h2><p>Your students will engage in their first guided practice with fresh reading selections every week!

These explore the way malaria, sugar cane, war, and nationalism interacted to produce the techno-politics of the modern Egyptian state; the forms of debt, discipline, and violence that founded the institution of private property; the methods of measurement, circulation, and exchange that produced the novel idea of a national "economy," yet made its accurate representation impossible; the stereotypes and plagiarisms that created the scholarly image of the Egyptian peasant; and the interaction of social logics, horticultural imperatives, powers of desire, and political forces that turned programs of economic reform in unanticipated directions.<br><br>Mitchell is a widely known political theorist and one of the most innovative writers on the Middle East.

Sloan Research Fellow. He has received numerous teaching awards, including the University of Georgia's <i>honoratus</i> medal in 1983 (for sustained excellence in honors teaching), its Josiah Meigs award in 1991 (the institution's highest award for teaching), and the 1997 statewide Georgia Regents award for research university faculty teaching excellence. His scholarly career has ranged from research and dissertation direction in topology to the history of mathematics to computing and technology in the teaching and applications of mathematics. In addition to being author or co-author of calculus, advanced calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations textbooks, he is well-known to calculus instructors as author of <i>The Historical Development of the Calculus</i> (Springer-Verlag, 1979). During the 1990s he served as a principal investigator on three NSF-supported projects: (1) A school mathematics project including Maple for beginning algebra students, (2) A Calculus-with-<i>Mathematica</i> program, and (3) A MATLAB-based computer lab project for numerical analysis and differential equations students.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>David E. Penney<i>,</i> </b> University of Georgia, completed his Ph.D. at Tulane University in 1965 (under the direction of Prof. L. Bruce Treybig) while teaching at the University of New Orleans. Earlier he had worked in experimental biophysics at Tulane University and the Veteran's Administration Hospital in New Orleans under the direction of Robert Dixon McAfee, where Dr. McAfee's research team's primary focus was on the active transport of sodium ions by biological membranes. Penney's primary contribution here was the development of a mathematical model (using simultaneous ordinary differential equations) for the metabolic phenomena regulating such transport, with potential future applications in kidney physiology, management of hypertension, and treatment of congestive heart failure. He also designed and constructed servomechanisms for the accurate monitoring of ion transport, a phenomenon involving the measurement of potentials in microvolts at impedances of millions of megohms. Penney began teaching calculus at Tulane in 1957 and taught that course almost every term with enthusiasm and distinction until his retirement at the end of the last millennium. During his tenure at the University of Georgia he received numerous University-wide teaching awards as well as directing several doctoral dissertations and seven undergraduate research projects.

Seemingly random events -- the flapping of a flag, a storm-driven wave striking the shore, a pinball&#x2019;s path -- often appear to have no order, no rational pattern. Explicating the theory of chaos and the consequences of its principal findings -- that actual, precise rules may govern such apparently random behavior -- has been a major part of the work of Edward N. Lorenz. In <i>The Essence of Chaos</i>, Lorenz presents to the general reader the features of this &#x201c;new science,&#x201d; with its far-reaching implications for much of modern life, from weather prediction to philosophy, and he describes its considerable impact on emerging scientific fields.<br><br>Unlike the phenomena dealt with in relativity theory and quantum mechanics, systems that are now described as &#x201c;chaotic&#x201d; can be observed without telescopes or microscopes. They range from the simplest happenings, such as the falling of a leaf, to the most complex processes, like the fluctuations of climate. Each process that qualifies, however, has certain quantifiable characteristics: how it unfolds depends very sensitively upon its present state, so that, even though it is not random, it seems to be. Lorenz uses examples from everyday life, and simple calculations, to show how the essential nature of chaotic systems can be understood. In order to expedite this task, he has constructed a mathematical model of a board sliding down a ski slope as his primary illustrative example. With this model as his base, he explains various chaotic phenomena, including some associated concepts such as strange attractors and bifurcations.<br><br>As a meteorologist, Lorenz initially became interested in the field of chaos because of its implications for weather forecasting. In a chapter ranging through the history of weather prediction and meteorology to a brief picture of our current understanding of climate, he introduces many of the researchers who conceived the experiments and theories, and he describes his own initial encounter with chaos.<br><br>A further discussion invites readers to make their own chaos. Still others debate the nature of randomness and its relationship to chaotic systems, and describe three related fields of scientific thought: nonlinearity, complexity, and fractality. Appendixes present the first publication of Lorenz&#x2019;s seminal paper &#x201c;Does the Flap of a Butterfly&#x2019;s Wing in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?&#x201d;; the mathematical equations from which the copious illustrations were derived; and a glossary.</p><p>&#39;For the personal glimpses of chaos theory development alone, this book is worth-while; for a clear, sharp development of the subject, the book is excellent; and for tying humanistic and scientific considerations together so well, there is a major debt owed to Lorenz.&#39;--GeophysicsSCI</p><h2>The Communication Playbook</h2><p><p><strong>Skills for becoming clear communicators, confident speakers, and sharp thinkers.</strong></p> <p>Designed for today&#x2019;s active learners, <strong>The Communication Playbook</strong> moves students beyond the classroom by helping them develop a strong communication skillset that will benefit them throughout their lives.

In a sense he invented philosophy as a distinct subject, for although many of these topics were discussed by his intellectual predecessors and contemporaries, he was the first to bring them together by giving them a unitary treatment. This volume contains fourteen new essays discussing Plato&#39;s views about knowledge, reality, mathematics, politics, ethics, love, poetry, and religion. There are also analyses of the intellectual and social background of his thought, the development of his philosophy throughout his career, the range of alternative approaches to his work, and the stylometry of his writing.</p><p>Fourteen new essays discuss Plato&#39;s views about knowledge, reality, mathematics, politics, ethics, love, poetry, and religion in a convenient, accessible guide that analyzes the intellectual and social background of his thought as well."This is an unusually well coordinated composite work, with a lengthy bibliography and good index. ...

Some readers have remarked that the book is more a comic book than a real novel, and it's true that reading this incendiary call to protect the American wilderness requires more than a little of the old willing suspension of disbelief. The story centers on Vietnam veteran George Washington Hayduke III, who returns to the desert to find his beloved canyons and rivers threatened by industrial development. On a rafting trip down the Colorado River, Hayduke joins forces with feminist saboteur Bonnie Abbzug, wilderness guide Seldom Seen Smith, and billboard torcher Doc Sarvis, M.D., and together they wander off to wage war on the big yellow machines, on dam builders and road builders and strip miners. As they do, his characters voice Abbey's concerns about wilderness preservation ("Hell of a place to lose a cow," Smith thinks to himself while roaming through the canyonlands of southern Utah. "Hell of a place to lose your heart. Hell of a place... to lose. Period"). Moving from one improbable situation to the next, packing more adventure into the space of a few weeks than most real people do in a lifetime, the motley gang puts fear into the hearts of their enemies, laughing all the while. It's comic, yes, and required reading for anyone who has come to love the desert. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Colonel Chabert</h2><p><p><strong>The story of a French military hero of the Napoleonic Wars, long assumed to be dead, tries to recover his fortune and former wife through the help of a famous Parisian lawyer.</strong></p> Colonel Chabert, a Napoleonic War hero supposedly killed in the Battle of Eylau, returns to Paris after a long convalescence to find his wife remarried, and his pension gone. He employs a young, well-known lawyer to at least reclaim his pension. It is a game of wits: first to convince the lawyer that he is who he says he is; secondly to get his wife to admit to his identity and thereby give up some of her wealth. Once the lawyer believes Chabert's story, the wife must be made to part with his pension...</p><p>Balzac once referred to art as &#34;nature concentrated&#34;. And nowhere did his own art achieve such a rarefied state as in Colonel Chabert - one of the celebrated &#34;Scenes from Private Life&#34; from La Comedie Humaine. Chabert is among Balzac&#39;s most tragic heroes: a decorated Napoleonic War veteran believed to have been killed in battle. Severely disfigured, the Colonel, returns to Paris as if risen from the grave. There he finds his wife remarried, his pension gone, and his name linked nostalgically to the faded days of Empire. Employing a young lawyer named Derville, Chabert finds an ally to negotiate the labyrinthine system of Restoration justice; but as Derville plays the game of law and intrigue, we discover why Balzac himself thought that most post-Revolutionary politics were plagued with corruption. Chabert, despite his dignity, his history, his status as a fallen warrior, is no match for a society driven by the wiles of lawyers.<p>Honor� de Balzac (1799&#x2013;1850), born in Tours, ranks among the great masters of the novel. In 1816, he began studying law at the Sorbonne, but after receiving his license in 1819 he decided to abandon it for literature. By the time of his death, he had written over one hundred novels, novellas, and plays, many of them part of his greatest work, <em>La Comedie humaine</em> &#x2013;&#x2013; a reproduction of the French society of his time, picturing in precise detail more than 2,000 characters from every class and every profession.</p><p><strong>Carol Cosman</strong> has translated works by Albert Camus and Ren� Daumal, among others.</p></p><h2>Death in the Afternoon</h2><p>A fascinating look at the history and grandeur of bullfighting, Death in the Afternoon is also a deeper contemplation on the nature of cowardice and bravery, sport and tragedy, and is enlivened throughout by Hemingway&#39;s pungent commentary on life and literature.

It reflects Hemingway's conviction that bullfighting was more than mere sport and reveals a rich source of inspiration for his art. The unrivaled drama of bullfighting, with its rigorous combination of athleticism and artistry, and its requisite display of grace under pressure, ignited Hemingway's imagination. Here he describes and explains the technical aspects of this dangerous ritual and "the emotional and spiritual intensity and pure classic beauty that can be produced by a man, an animal, and a piece of scarlet serge draped on a stick". Seen through his eyes, bullfighting becomes a richly choreographed ballet, with performers who range from awkward amateurs to masters of great elegance and cunning.<p>A fascinating look at the history and grandeur of bullfighting, Death in the Afternoon is also a deeper contemplation of the nature of cowardice and bravery, sport and tragedy, and is enlivened throughout by Hemingway's sharp commentary on life and literature.</p></p><h2>Panic</h2><p><p>From <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Lauren Oliver comes an extraordinary novel of fear, friendship, courage, and hope that <em>Kirkus Reviews</em> says "will have readers up until the wee hours," <em>School Library Journal</em> raves is "fast-paced and captivating," and E. Lockhart, author of <em>We Were Liars</em>, calls "a thrill a minute."</p><p>Panic began as so many things do in Carp, a poor town of twelve thousand people in the middle of nowhere: because it was summer, and there was nothing else to do. Heather never thought she would compete in panic, a legendary game played by graduating seniors. She'd never thought of herself as fearless, the kind of person who would fight to stand out. But when she finds something, and someone, to fight for, she will discover that she is braver than she ever thought. </p><p>Dodge has never been afraid of panic. His secret will fuel him, and get him all the way through the game; he's sure of it. But what he doesn't know is that he's not the only one with a secret. Everyone has something to play for. For Heather and Dodge, the game will bring new alliances, unexpected revelations, and the possibility of first love for each of them&#x2014;and the knowledge that sometimes the very things we fear are those we need the most. </p></p><p><p><b>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, March 2014:</b> Imagine a game that required you to walk, on a dark rainy night, across a narrow plank 50 feet in the air between two water towers. What could be worth that or any of the other terrifying tests of reckless courage in the game of Panic? For Dodge and Heather, graduating high school seniors of Carp, population 12,000, winning means a $67,000 chance at freedom from their claustrophobic town. In <i>Panic</i>, Lauren Oliver's characters are imbued with the emotional intricacy of teenagers hungry for both connection and new beginnings, some hiding secrets that blunt even the most frightening challenge the game can impose. Although there can only be one winner, a competition based on fear shapes powerful new relationships, understanding, and even forgiveness. --<i>Seira Wilson</i></p> <br> <p><b>PANIC Playlist by Lauren Oliver</b></p> <p>One of the things I loved most about writing Panic was that the fictional town of Carp became, in a way, a secondary character. Carp is small, and it&#x2019;s poor; it&#x2019;s a place where opportunities come rarely, if ever, and change comes not at all. Most of all, it&#x2019;s a place that inspires dreams of escape. I&#x2019;ve assembled this playlist with Carp&#x2014;and the places like it, filled with people who dream of getting out&#x2014;in mind.</p> <p>&#x201c;Blowin' Smoke&#x201d; by Kacey Musgraves: I love the way this song focuses on a very specific moment in the day of a small-town waitress. The waitresses talk about their plans to get out, to live a better life, but in the end all they&#x2019;re doing is &#x201c;blowing smoke.&#x201d; The song paints a great picture of these characters with both humor and pathos.</p> <p>&#x201c;Spaceship&#x201d; Feat.

Springsteen has so many songs that could have made the list, but this one is a classic! &#x201c;Baby this town rips the bones from your back, it&#x2019;s a death trap, it&#x2019;s a suicide rap.

This song shows that there are other options, other paths you can take, even if you have to be &#x201c;taking the long way&#x201d; to get there. This is the story of someone who made it out.</p> <p>&#x201c;Fast Car&#x201d; by Tracy Chapman: No matter how many times I hear it, this song breaks my heart. Tracy Chapman tells the story of a person who believes she&#x2019;s going to make it away from her insular and impoverished life, only to find herself trapped in the same cycle she thought she was escaping. In the chorus, she reminisces about the brief time in which it seemed as though everything was going to get better. It hurts in the most beautiful way. Confession: this was my all-time most-played song in high school.</p> <p>&#x201c;Merry Go &#x2019;Round&#x201d; by Kacey Musgraves: I know, this is the second song I&#x2019;ve included from Kacey Musgraves, but hey&#x2014;if ain&#x2019;t broke, don&#x2019;t fix it. &#x201c;Merry Go &#x2019;Round&#x201d; is the perfect metaphor for the systematic cycles of poverty, alcoholism, and drug abuse that ensnares people in places like Carp. &#x201c;Just like dust, we settle in this town.&#x201d;</p><p>Panic began as so many things do in Carp, a poor town of twelve thousand people in the middle of nowhere: because it was summer, and there was nothing else to do.</p><p>Heather never thought she would compete in panic, a legendary game played by graduating seniors, where the stakes are high and the payoff is even higher.

Susanka and Vassallo focus their lens on the tangible and sometimes intangible details that bring an otherwise ordinary home to life. Incorporating such details as dropped ceilings, built-in shelves, pocket doors, window seats, and well-placed alcoves infuses a home with the character of its owners and conveys a uniqueness that&#39;s mising in many homes built or remodeled today. From Rhode Island to San Diego, the 23 homes featured here illustrate exceptional attention to detail. Each offers inspiration for those building or remodeling to transform their home into an expression of all that is important to them.</p><p>Sarah Susanka is one of the leading residential architects in the United States. Her first book, "The Not So Big House," topped best-seller charts in Home &amp; Garden categories in its first year of publication. Susanka has appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show, the Charlie Rose Show, and NPR's Diane Rehm Show. She is a former principal and founding partner of Mulfinger, Susanka, Mahady &amp; Partners, Inc., the firm chosen by LIFE magazine to design its 1999 Dream House."Sarah Susanka has teamed up with design writer Marc Vassallo to help her readers incorporate the details of not-so-big living into their decorating schemes...As the 25 homes featured in the book demonstrate, such additions combine good looks with function to unify and enhance interior spaces.""- Boston Globe"<br>"Susanka has become the poster girl for an architectural movement that worships scale and simplicity. Here she and Vassallo go inside 23 not-so-big houses to illustrate the details -- built-in storage, diverse ceiling heights and materials, color, simplicity, tricks of the eye -- that not only give a house personality but also make it more livable."<br>- Lynette Evans, "San Francisco Chronicle"</p><h2>Mensch-Marks: Life Lessons of a Human Rabbi&#x2015;Wisdom for Untethered Times</h2><p>The Talmud states, "In a world that lacks humanity, be human." In a world as untethered as ours has become, simply being human, a good person, is a measure of heroism. At a time when norms of civility are being routinely overwhelmed, it may be the only measure that matters. <i>Mensch-Marks</i>&nbsp;represents Rabbi Joshua Hammerman's personal Torah scroll&#x2014;the sacred text of his experiences, the life lessons he has learned along his winding, circuitous journey. Mirroring 42 steps Israel wandered in the Wilderness, Hammerman offers 42 brief essays, several of which first appeared in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>,&nbsp; organized into categories of character, or "<i>mensch-marks</i>," each one a stepping stone toward spiritual maturation. These essays span most of Rabbi Hammerman's life, revealing how he has striven to be a "<i>mensch</i>," a human of character, through every challenge.<br><br><i> </i><br><i>Mensch-Marks<b> </b></i>creates a brand-new genre. It is memoir as sacred story, as how-to book; a series of personal vignettes in dialogue with one another over the span of decades, resonating with eternal ideas that span centuries. It traces the author's own personal growth while providing a road map for people of all backgrounds seeking a life of moral vision. The wisdom is shared not from a pulpit on high, but rather from an unfolding story of a fellow traveler, one who has stumbled, failed, and persevered, struggling with the questions large and small. Through it all, Rabbi Hammerman has tried to live with dignity and grace, what he calls the "nobility of normalcy."<br>He writes, "If by sharing what I've learned, I can add a modicum of generosity, honesty and human connection in a world overflowing with cruelty, loneliness and deceit, then I'll have done my job.' The essays cover crucial moments of failure and forgiveness, loving and letting go, finding deeper meaning in one's work, and holiness in the seemingly inconsequential moments of everyday life.&nbsp; Rabbi Hammerman, ever the optimist, believes that we can turn things around, one <i>mensch </i>at a time.<br><i> </i></p><p>Joshua Hammerman, a celebrated rabbi and award-winning journalist and blogger, has served Temple Beth El in Stamford, Connecticut, for over three decades.

In which I explore my sacred profession. </b></p> <p>'Work' has always meant something other than 'daily drudgery' in Jewish tradition. From the earliest days of the Bible to the advent of modern secular Zionism, there has always been something sacred about the work we do. In fact, the Hebrew words for work are directly connected to the sacred. The most common term, <i>avodah, </i>not only means 'work,' it also is the term used for the sacrificial rites followed in the days of the ancient Temple. Later, when the Temple was destroyed, avodah came to be associated with that which replaced sacrifices: prayer. Our work is nothing less than a supreme offering to God, whether one is a rabbi, minister, imam, doctor, or welder. I see my task as being analogous to that of the ancient biblical prophet, of whom Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote, 'He is neither a singing saint nor a moralizing poet. His images must not shine, they must burn.' Work and worship stand united, for one leads to the other; prayer leads to world-mending activity, and such activity engenders awe and gratitude. That should be the case for all work, but it certainly must be the case for my profession. It has been for me.</p> <p>'<i>People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day.'</i>&#x2015;A.

Everyone abided by Leviticus 19:32: 'Stand before the gray haired one [your elder].' No longer. It's sad, and not just for elders. Back in 1985, I could sense this transition happening and gave expression to my feelings in the following article, appearing in <i>The New York Times Magazine,</i> which forced me to question whether any age would arrive when I would feel completely comfortable in my rabbinic role. But my encounters with ageism enabled me to hone a broader message and dedicate my life's work to breaking down all stereotypes that hide the true essence of our humanity.</p> <p>I am twenty-eight years old and a rabbi. Had I chosen to be a gymnast or tennis player, I would be considered past my prime. As a lawyer or computer engineer, I would be reaching the peak of yuppiedom. In my own eyes, I fret at how quickly the years pass while I helplessly watch my youthful vigor recede.</p> <p>And yet, when I walk into my office each morning, I feel like a seventeen-year-old walking into a bar, fearful that some hulk of a bouncer will appear to check me for ID. I am a child in a profession where life begins at sixty.</p> <p>Being a rabbi at any age inhibits normal social intercourse; being a young rabbi compounds the problem acutely. I am an anomaly in a community where rabbis are expected to have gray beards and the all-knowing countenance of one who is nearing the end of life's tumultuous journey.</p> <p>I know that I am not alone; in many fields it is not easy to be young. In the two years since my ordination, I have left many a hospital room wondering whether the patients give their young doctors the same incredulous looks they often give me. A thirty-year-old dentist tells me of the difficulties of starting a practice&#x2015;he wonders whether people will be willing to entrust their sacred smiles to one so young. Another friend, a psychologist, labors to establish his professional reputation. I feel for him, as well as for all the young men and women who strain to reach the next rung on the corporate ladder, only to be quashed by someone older. I feel for those who fritter away a half dozen precious years of youth at prestigious law firms, only to find that no partnership awaits them.</p> <p>And yet my own position is particularly awkward. The awkwardness goes beyond the fact that I address doctors and judges by their first names while they call me by my title even when they are four decades my senior. It reaches beyond the fact that I commonly marry couples much older than I or that some of the more grandmotherly types I come across like to pinch my cheek. Wherever I go age is an issue, for not only am I cursed by being young, I am cursed by looking young. When the author of Ecclesiastes wrote, ''Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth,'' he was not speaking to a convention of young rabbis.</p> <p>I can understand why many of my rabbinical colleagues and classmates choose to pursue other advanced degrees before entering the pulpit, while others prefer to spend years of tutelage under the wings of established rabbis in suburbia. Some, like me, stand alone, unprotected, and uneasy, but most are located somewhere out on the prairie, planting Jewish roots in places where most of the natives have never seen a rabbi before. But here I am, in a pulpit just a hop from New York, where people know what a good bagel&#x2015;and a good rabbi&#x2015;should look like.</p> <p>If I seem overly energetic to my congregation, the quality is attributed to my age. My rather too apparent self-respect is something, they say, that will diminish 'when I know better.' Occasionally I am seen as being manipulated by one congregant or another; I am said to be easy prey because of my lack of experience. At a recent wedding, the father of the bride told me that I look more like a bookie than a rabbi. I made light of it (neither job, I said to him, is suitable for a nice Jewish boy), but I was sensitive to the anxiety underlying his remark. He was giving his daughter away, and the man who was going to put the stamp of God on the whole enterprise could just as easily be standing next to her&#x2015;except that he's much younger.</p> <p>My congregants ask themselves: How can this rabbi be mature enough to comfort mourners when he hasn't known a lifetime of personal grief? How can he advise parents about their children when he hasn't yet reared children of his own? How can he counsel troubled couples when he hasn't been married long enough to experience marital strife? How can he represent us before God when he hasn't been through our suffering, when he hasn't seen what we've seen? Can a rabbi who is not battle scarred truly be a rabbi?</p> <p>�2019 Joshua Hammerman. All rights reserved.

And the gospel I inherited is divided."</strong> Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove grew up in the Bible Belt in the American South as a faithful church-going Christian. But he gradually came to realize that the gospel his Christianity proclaimed was not good news for everybody. The same Christianity that sang, "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound" also perpetuated racial injustice and white supremacy in the name of Jesus. His Christianity, he discovered, was the religion of the slaveholder. Just as Reconstruction after the Civil War worked to repair a desperately broken society, our compromised Christianity requires a spiritual reconstruction that undoes the injustices of the past. Wilson-Hartgrove traces his journey from the religion of the slaveholder to the Christianity of Christ. Reconstructing the gospel requires facing the pain of the past and present, from racial blindness to systemic abuses of power. Grappling seriously with troubling history and theology, Wilson-Hartgrove recovers the subversiveness of the gospel that sustained the church through centuries of slavery and oppression, from the civil rights era to the Black Lives Matter movement and beyond. When the gospel is reconstructed, freedom rings for both individuals and society as a whole. Discover how Jesus continues to save us from ourselves and each other, to repair the breach and heal our land.</p><p>"So what happened to Christianity in America? This is the question my brother Jonathan faces head-on in this book. He follows this question to the heart of America's original sin, and he invites all of us to join him there and face another question: is our God greater than America's racism? This is a question we must answer, no matter the color of our skin. Slaveholder religion has infected every corner of the church in America&#x2015;including the black church. We must never forget that there were enslaved people who accepted the theology fed to them on plantations." (From the foreword by Dr. William J. Barber II)<br><br>"This book contains the message I have been longing to hear for several years now. It is the book so many of us need to read." (D. L. Mayfield, author of Assimilate or Go Home)<br><br>"Jonathan is a moral prophet and spiritual physician for our time. In this timely book, with the precision of a heart surgeon, he exposes the sickness that has long-plagued American Christianity and infected our society and politics, revealing that none of us is untouched by the disease. With the credibility of his life lived in solidarity with systemically oppressed people, he resounds a clarion call to reform the way in which we live the gospel. This is a must-read for all Christians in America. You will be humbled, enlightened, and motivated to heal the ailing heart of our country and recover its soul." (Phileena Heuertz, founding partner, Gravity, a Center for Contemplative Activism)<br><br>"God has entrusted Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove with a message&#x2015;the gospel of Jesus Christ has been tragically defaced by American white supremacy and must be reconstructed. In this passionate, fast-paced book, Jonathan gives us a distinctively Christological, hopeful path toward faithful reconstruction. God is able! Even though we, in our structures of sin, often feel powerless to exorcise the demon of white racism, know that God&#x2019;s will shall be done, and God&#x2019;s reign will come because God&#x2019;s purposes shall not be defeated. What an empowering, hopeful word Jonathan has for Christians, white and black." (Will Willimon, professor of the practice of Christian ministry, author of Who Lynched Willie Earle? and Preaching to Confront Racism)<br><br>"In this insightful, accessible volume readers are introduced to the original sin of racism in the United States, which was first and foremost an economic system to benefit the few at the expense of the many. Racism is woven into the fabric of American institutions, and it will require systemic change to bring about true reconciliation. &#x2018;A gospel that doesn't confront racism is no gospel at all,&#x2019; writes Wilson-Hartgrove, for the work of the gospel is to heal that which is divided and to reconcile that which has been torn apart. This book is a must-read for the church." (Elaine A.

Japanese companies are sweeping the world, as Western companies and governments struggle to find ways to emulate them. <br> <i>The Machine That Changed the World</i> points for the first time to a positive way out of this dilemma. It shows that being defeatist about the Japanese threat, and tougher protectionism, are not the answers. <br> This book outlines the enormous tasks facing Western companies in the 1990s and has cogent messages for Japanese firms as well, as they move abroad. <br> <i>The Machine That Changed the World</i> is based on the largest and most thorough study ever undertaken in any industry: the Massachusetts Institute of Technology five-million-dollar, five-year, fourteen-country International Motor Vehicle Program's study of the worldwide auto industry. <br> Twice in this century the auto industry has changed our most fundamental ideas about how to make things. Now it is doing it again. Just as mass production swept away craft production, so a new way of making things, called lean production, is now rapidly making mass production obsolete. <br> Lean production is the Japanese secret weapon in the industrial wars and is spreading throughout the world. If Western companies and their managers and workers are to survive in the 1990s, they must learn and adapt to lean production. Some of the smartest already have begun to do so. <br> Lean production welds the activities of everyone from top management to line workers, to suppliers, into a tightly integrated whole that can respond almost instantly to marketing demands from consumers. It can also double production and quality, while keeping costs down. Its adoption, as it inevitably spreads beyond the auto industry, will change almost every industry and consequently how we work, how we live, and the fate of companies and nations as they respond to its impact. <br> In clear and compelling terms, this book explains what lean production is, and its global implications for all of us.</p><p><b>James P. Womack</b> is the president and founder of the Lean Enterprise Institute (www.lean.org), a nonprofit education and research organization based in Brookline, Massachusetts.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>THE INDUSTRY OF INDUSTRIES IN TRANSITION</b><br><br>Forty years ago Peter Drucker dubbed it "the industry of industries." Today, automobile manufacturing is still the world's largest manufacturing activity, with nearly 50 million new vehicles produced each year.<br><br>Most of us own one, many of us own several, and, although we may be unaware of it, these cars and trucks are an important part of our everyday lives.<br><br>Yet the auto industry is even more important to us than it appears. Twice in this century it has changed our most fundamental ideas of how we make things. And how we make things dictates not only how we work but what we buy, how we think, and the way we live.<br><br>After World War I, Henry Ford and General Motors' Alfred Sloan moved world manufacture from centuries of craft production -- led by European firms -- into the age of mass production. Largely as a result, the United States soon dominated the global economy.<br><br>After World War II, Eiji Toyoda and Taiichi Ohno at the Toyota Motor Company in Japan pioneered the concept of lean production. The rise of Japan to its current economic preeminence quickly followed, as other Japanese companies and industries copied this remarkable system.<br><br>Manufacturers around the world are now trying to embrace lean production, but they're finding the going rough. The companies that first mastered this system were all headquartered in one country -- Japan. As lean production has spread to North America and Western Europe under their aegis, trade wars and growing resistance to foreign investment have followed.<br><br>Today, we hear constantly that the world faces a massive overcapacity crisis -- estimated by some industry executives at more than 8 million units in excess of current world sales of about 50 million units. This is, in fact, a misnomer. The world has an acute shortage of competitive lean-production capacity and a vast glut of uncompetitive mass-production capacity. The crisis is caused by the former threatening the latter.<br><br>Many Western companies now understand lean production, and at least one is well along the path to introducing it. However, superimposing lean-production methods on existing mass-production systems causes great pain and dislocation. In the absence of a crisis threatening the very survival of the company, only limited progress seems to be possible.<br><br>General Motors is the most striking example. This gigantic company is still the world's largest industrial concern and was without doubt the best at mass production, a system it helped to create. Now, in the age of lean production, it finds itself with too many managers, too many workers, and too many plants. Yet GM has not yet faced a life-or-death crisis, as the Ford Motor Company did in the early 1980s, and thus it has not been able to change.<br><br>This book is an effort to ease the necessary transition from mass production to lean. By focusing on the global auto industry, we explain in simple, concrete terms what lean production is, where it came from, how it really works, and how it can spread to all corners of the globe for everyone's mutual benefit.<br><br>But why should we care if world manufacturers jettison decades of mass production to embrace lean production? Because the adoption of lean production, as it inevitably spreads beyond the auto industry, will change everything in almost every industry -- choices for consumers, the nature of work, the fortune of companies, and, ultimately, the fate of nations.<br><br>What is lean production? Perhaps the best way to describe this innovative production system is to contrast it with craft production and mass production, the two other methods humans have devised to make things.<br><br>The craft producer uses highly skilled workers and simple but flexible tools to make exactly what the consumer asks for -- one item at a time. Custom furniture, works of decorative art, and a few exotic sports cars provide current-day examples. We all love the idea of craft production, but the problem with it is obvious: Goods produced by the craft method -- as automobiles once were exclusively -- cost too much for most of us to afford. So mass production was developed at the beginning of the twentieth century as an alternative.<br><br>The mass-producer uses narrowly skilled professionals to design products made by unskilled or semiskilled workers tending expensive, single-purpose machines. These churn out standardized products in very high volume. Because the machinery costs so much and is so intolerant of disruption, the mass-producer adds many buffers -- extra supplies, extra workers, and extra space -- to assure smooth production. Because changing over to a new product costs even more, the mass-producer keeps standard designs in production for as long as possible. The result: The consumer gets lower costs but at the expense of variety and by means of work methods that most employees find boring and dispiriting.<br><br>The lean producer, by contrast, combines the advantages of craft and mass production, while avoiding the high cost of the former and the rigidity of the latter. Toward this end, lean producers employ teams of multiskilled workers at all levels of the organization and use highly flexible, increasingly automated machines to produce volumes of products in enormous variety.<br><br>Lean production (a term coined by IMVP researcher John Krafcik) is "lean" because it uses less of everything compared with mass production half the human effort in the factory, half the manufacturing space, half the investment in tools, half the engineering hours to develop a new product in half the time. Also, it requires keeping far less than half the needed inventory on site, results in many fewer defects, and produces a greater and ever growing variety of products.<br><br>Perhaps the most striking difference between mass production and lean production lies in their ultimate objectives. Mass-producers set a limited goal for themselves -- "good enough," which translates into an acceptable number of defects, a maximum acceptable level of inventories, a narrow range of standardized products. To do better, they argue, would cost too much or exceed inherent human capabilities.<br><br>Lean producers, on the other hand, set their sights explicitly on perfection: continually declining costs, zero defects, zero inventories, and endless product variety. Of course, no lean producer has ever reached this promised land -- and perhaps none ever will, but the endless quest for perfection continues to generate surprising twists.<br><br>For one, lean production changes how people work but not always in the way we think. Most people -- including so-called blue-collar workers -- will find their jobs more challenging as lean production spreads. And they will certainly become more productive. At the same time, they may find their work more stressful, because a key objective of lean production is to push responsibility far down the organizational ladder. Responsibility means freedom to control one's work -- a big plus -- but it also raises anxiety about making costly mistakes.<br><br>Similarly, lean production changes the meaning of professional careers. In the West, we are accustomed to think of careers as a continual progression to ever higher levels of technical know-how and proficiency in an ever narrower area of specialization as well as responsibility for ever larger numbers of subordinates -- director of accounting, chief production engineer, and so on.<br><br>Lean production calls for learning far more professional skills and applying these creatively in a team setting rather than in a rigid hierarchy. The paradox is that the better you are at teamwork, the less you may know about a specific, narrow specialty that you can take with you to another company or to start a new business. What's more, many employees may find the lack of a steep career ladder with ever more elaborate titles and job descriptions both disappointing and disconcerting.<br><br>If employees are to prosper in this environment, companies must offer them a continuing variety of challenges. That way, they will feel they are honing their skills and are valued for the many kinds of expertise they have attained. Without these continual challenges, workers may feel they have reached a dead end at an early point in their career. The result: They hold back their know-how and commitment, and the main advantage of lean production disappears.<br><br>This sketch of lean production and its effects is highly simplified, of course. Where did this new idea come from and precisely how does it work in practice? Why will it result in such profound political and economic changes throughout the world? In this book we provide the answers.<br><br>In "The Origins of Lean Production," we trace the evolution of lean production. We then look in "The Elements of Lean Production" at how lean production works in factory operations, product development, supply-system coordination, customer relations and as a total lean enterprise.<br><br>Finally, in "Diffusing Lean Production," we examine how lean production is spreading across the world and to other industries and, in the process, is revolutionizing how we live and work. As we'll also see, however, lean production isn't spreading everywhere at a uniform rate. So we'll look at the barriers that are preventing companies and countries from becoming lean. And we'll suggest creative ways leanness can be achieved.<br><br>Copyright � 1990 by James P. Womack, Daniel T.

The nuzzle of a dog&#x2019;s nose, the warmth of them lying at our feet, even their whining when they want to get up on the bed. It really seems like our dogs love us, too. But for years, scientists have resisted that conclusion, warning against anthropomorphizing our pets. Enter Clive Wynne, a pioneering canine behaviorist whose research is helping to usher in a new era: one in which love, not intelligence or submissiveness, is at the heart of the human-canine relationship. Drawing on cutting-edge studies from his lab and others around the world, Wynne shows that affection is the very essence of dogs, from their faces and tails to their brains, hormones, even DNA. This scientific revolution is revealing more about dogs&#x2019; unique origins, behavior, needs, and hidden depths than we ever imagined possible.<br><br> A humane, illuminating book, <i>Dog Is Love</i> is essential reading for anyone who has ever loved a dog&#x2014;and experienced the wonder of being loved back.</p><p>CLIVE D.L.

Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or private life. It is known that she was born in Wimbledon in August 1902, and her first novel, The Black Moth, was published in 1921. <br><br>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Heyer's large volume of works included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known also as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer, and they had one son together, Richard.<p><strong>Prologue</strong></p> <p>There was so much noise in the market-place, such a hubbub of shouting and chaffering, that Herleva dragged herself to the window of her chamber and stood peeping down through the willow-slats that made a lattice over the opening. Market days brought a mob of people to Falaise from all the neighbouring countryside. There were franklins with slaves driving in the swine and cattle for sale; serfs with eggs and furmage spread on cloths upon the ground; great men's stewards and men-at-arms; knights' ladies on ambling palfreys; burghers from the town; and young maidens in troops of four or five together with little spending-silver in their purses, but full of exclamations for every novelty that met their eyes.</p> <p>Wandering pedlars with their pack-horses had tempting wares to show: brooches of amethyst and garnet; bone combs; and silver mirrors burnished until one might see one's face in them as clearly as in the beck that ran below the Castle. There were stalls piled high with candles, and oil, and smear; others with spices from the East spreading an aromatic scent: galingale, cloves, cubebs, and sweet canelle. Hard by, the food-merchants had set up their shelds, and here could be bought lampreys and herrings, fresh caught; such rare stores as ginger, and sugar, and pepper; jars of Lombard mustard; and loaves of wastel-bread, each one bearing the baker's seal. Beyond these a chapman with copper-pots, and chargeours for the table plied a brisk trade among the housewives; while near at hand an apothecary tried to catch the women's attention with his salves for bruises, his dragon's water, and angelica-root, and even, slyly whispered, his love-philtres. His mild voice was drowned by the shouts of his neighbour, who spread length upon length of falding and sendal over his stall, and bade every passer-by see and feel his fine cloths.</p> <p>But the crowd was thickest round the foreign pedlars, who had stranger merchandise to offer. There was jet brought from outremer which would drive away serpents if one heated it; finer cloth than falding held up by the Frisian merchants; cunningly wrought cups and jewels shown by dark Byzantines; orfrey, embroidered by Saxon women in England; and any number of trinkets, and ribands for the binding of one's hair.</p> <p>As she caught sight of one of these bunches, invitingly held up to a knot of maids below her window, Herleva lifted the heavy plait that lay over her shoulder, wondering whether a scarlet riband would look well twisted round it, and whether my lord Robert would think her pretty decked out in red. But nobody, not even so hot a lover as my lord Count, could think her pretty just now, she reflected. She was heavy with child, very near her time, and my lord Count was away in Rouen, waiting upon the pleasure of his father, good Duke Richard of Normandy. She wished that her pains might start, and the birth be soon over, so that she might ride up the steep hill again to the Castle that crowned one of its crags, and call upon the men-at-arms to open: open to Herleva the Beautiful, daughter of Fulbert, burgess of Falaise, and mistress of my lord Count of Hiesmes. Involuntarily her eyes turned towards the Castle, which she could just see, high above the squat wooden houses of the town and half-hidden by the trees that climbed its hill.</p> <p>She thrust out her lower lip a little, picturing to herself the haute ladies of the Court at Rouen. She felt ill-used, and had begun to dwell upon her fancied wrongs, when her attention was diverted by a troop of minstrels who had begun to play quite near the house. They had come to the market on the chance of a few coins from the younger and lighter-hearted of the crowd, and perhaps a bite of supper afterwards in one of the rich burgher's halls. The harper started to sing a popular chanson, while the juggler in his train cast up plates and balls into the air, and caught them all one after the other, faster and faster, until Herleva's eyes grew round with wonder.</p> <p>From the window Herleva could see her father Fulbert's sheld, with the furs hanging up in it, and her brother Walter haggling with a burgher over the price of a fine rug of marten-skins. Close beside was a chapman who held up trinkets before the eyes of several envious maidens. If Count Robert had been there he would have bought his love the bracelet of hammered gold which the pedlar kept on showing, thought Herleva.</p> <p>The remembrance of my lord Count made her discontented, and she moved away from the window, already weary of the bustle below it.</p> <p>At the far end of the room a wooden door gave directly on to the twisting stair that led down to the hall, the principal dwelling-place of the house. No doubt her mother was busy preparing supper for Fulbert and Walter, but Herleva had no mind to go down to help her. The mistress of the son of the Duke of Normandy, she thought, had nothing to do with cooking-pots and greasy patins.</p> <p>She crossed the floor with lagging steps, pushing the rushes with her feet, and laid herself down on the bed of skins against the wall. It was a bed for a Duchess, truly, made of good wood, and covered over with a bearskin which Fulbert had said grudgingly was more fit for Count Robert than for his mie. Herleva snuggled her cheek into the long fur, and smoothed it with her little hot hand, thinking of Count Robert, and how he called her, in his extravagant way, his princess.</p> <p>Outside the sun was sinking slowly behind the heaths that lay beyond the town. A beam of gold came in through the willow-lattice, and struck the foot of the bed, making the brown hairs of the bearskin glint to an auburn glow. The hum of chatter, and the noise of the horses' hooves, the occasional sharp sound of a voice raised above the general hubbub still continued in the market-place, but it had grown less with the sinking of the sun, and would soon cease altogether. Peasants from outlying villages were departing already from Falaise to reach home in the safe daylight; the chapmen were packing their bundles; and a stream of mules and sumpters was wending its way under the window towards the gates of the town.</p> <p>The measured clop of the hooves made Herleva drowsy; she presently closed her eyes, and after some restless twisting and turning upon the bed, dropped off into an uneasy slumber.</p> <p>Gradually the shaft of sunshine disappeared, and with the deepening of the shadows the noise in the market-place died away. The last pack-horse was led slowly past the house; and the merchants who lived within the town were all busy fastening up their shutters, and comparing each his day's fortune with his neighbours'.</p> <p>The light faded quite away; the cool of the evening stole into the chamber; Herleva shivered and moaned in her sleep, troubled by strange dreams.</p> <p>She dreamed that as she lay a tree grew up out of her womb, spreading steadily till it became a giant among trees, with great branches stretched out like grasping arms. Then she perceived, in her dream, that Normandy lay before her gaze, even to the remotest corner of the C�tentin, and the far outpost of Eu. She saw the grey, tumbling sea, and was afraid, and cried out. The cry was muffled in her sleep, but beads of sweat started on her brow. Land lay beyond the sea; she saw it plainly, and knew it for England. And while she lay sweating in a strange terror she saw that the branches of the tree stretched out further and further till they over-shadowed both England and Normandy.</p> <p>She screamed, and started up on the bed, pressing her hands to her eyes. Her face was wet with her fright; she wiped away the sweat with her fingers, and dared at last, as she realized that she had awakened from a nightmare, to look about her.</p> <p>Her mother, Duxia, was standing in the doorway with a rushlight in her hand. &#x2018;That was a great shout I heard you make,' she said. &#x2018;I thought the pains had come upon you, and here I find you sleeping.'</p> <p>Herleva found that she was very cold. She pulled up the bearskin round her shoulders, and looked at Duxia in a boding way. She said in a low voice: &#x2018;I dreamed that a tree grew up out of my womb, mother, and no babe.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, yes,' Duxia replied, &#x2018;we have all our fancies at these times, daughter.'</p> <p>Herleva clasped the bearskin closer round her, with her hands crossed between her breasts. &#x2018;And as I lay,' she said in a hushed voice, &#x2018;I saw two countries spread before me, and these were our land of Normandy in all its might, and the land of the English Saxons, over the grey water.' She let go one hand from the bearskin and pointed where she thought England might be. The bearskin slipped back from her shoulders, but she seemed no longer to feel the chill in her flesh. She fixed her eyes upon Duxia, and in the flickering rushlight they glowed queerly. &#x2018;And the tree of my womb put forth huge branches that were as hands that would seize and hold fast, and these stretched out on either side me till Normandy and England both lay beneath them, cowering in their shadow.'</p> <p>Duxia said: &#x2018;Well, that's a strange dream indeed, but meanwhile here is your father sitting down to his supper, and if you don't bestir yourself the pottage will be cold before you come to it.'</p> <p>But Herleva still sat motionless upon the bed, and Duxia, coming further into the room, perceived that she had a strange look in her face as of one who sees marvels beyond ordinary folks' vision. She laid her hands suddenly about her middle and said in a voice that had grown strong and clear: &#x2018;My son will be a King. He shall grasp and hold, and he shall rule over Normandy and England, even as the tree stretched out its branches.'</p> <p>This seemed a great piece of nonsense to Duxia. She was just about to make some soothing remark when Herleva gave a cry of pain, and straightened her body, with her muscles stiff to meet the sudden hurt.</p> <p>&#x2018;Mother! Mother!'</p> <p>Duxia began to bustle about her daughter at that, and both of them forgot all about the dream and its meaning. &#x2018;There, child, that is nothing. You will have worse pain before you are better,' Duxia said. &#x2018;We will send out to summon our neighbour Emma, for she's a rare one at a lying-in, and I warrant has helped more babes into the world than you will ever bear. Lie still; there is time enough yet.'</p> <p>She had no leisure to think any more about Herleva's prophecy, for Fulbert was calling for the boiled meats downstairs, and at the same time Herleva was clinging to her with both hands, very much afraid, and expecting every moment to undergo another such agony. Duxia found that she had her hands full for the next hour, but presently Emma came into the hall, and after she had seen Herleva and said that they might look for nothing for some hours yet, she helped Duxia clear away the dirty platters from the table, and directed the serfs how they should place the straw and the skins for the master's bed.</p> <p>Fulbert was fond of Herleva, but he was a sensible man, and he had a hard day's work before him on the morrow, so that he thought he would be a great fool if he lost his sleep for nothing more serious than a lying-in. Moreover, he had never quite liked his daughter's position, and though none of the neighbours considered it anything but an honour for Herleva to be the mistress of so puissant a seigneur as my lord Count of Hiesmes, he still could not feel at ease about it. As he made himself ready for the night, he felt that he would have been better pleased if the child to be born had been the lawful son of an honest burgher instead of a noble bastard.</p> <p>When everything was set in order in the hall, and all the household disposed round the master for sleep, Duxia and Emma went off up the stairs to the room where Herleva lay whimpering upon her fine bedstead.</p> <p>Emma was the wisest woman in Falaise. She knew the signs of the stars, and she could read omens, and foretell great happenings, so that presently as the two women sat on stools by a small brazier of charcoal Duxia was minded to tell her of Herleva's dream. The two coiffed heads drew close together, and the red glow from the brazier showed the lined faces intent and knowing. Emma nodded, and clicked her tongue in her cheek. It was very likely, she said, and she went on to tell Duxia of other such visions which she had seen happily fulfilled.</p> <p>An hour after midnight the child was born. A cock in some shed not far away, perhaps catching sight of a star through a chink in the door, crowed once, and then was silent.</p> <p>There was a pallet of straw in a corner of the room near the brazier. Emma wrapped the babe loosely round in a cloth and laid him down upon this pallet, where he would be safe while she turned back to Herleva. When Duxia presently went to pick up the child she found that he had thrust his arms from out of the cloth, and was clutching the straw on which he lay in both his fists. She was glad to see that he was so lusty an infant, and called to Emma to admire his strength. Perhaps the prophecy was running in Emma's head, or perhaps she had never seen a newborn child so vigorous. &#x2018;Mark what I say, Duxia!' she exclaimed, &#x2018;that child will be a great prince. See how he takes seisin of the world! He'll grasp everything that comes in his way and out of it, you see if he doesn't.'</p> <p>Her words reached Herleva, who seemed to herself to be sinking leagues deep into a heavy swoon. She said faintly: &#x2018;He will be a King.'</p> <p>As soon as she was well enough to think and plan again Herleva sent for Walter, and insisted that he should ride to Rouen to tell the Count of the birth of his son. Walter was too fond of her to resent her imperious ways, but Fulbert, who needed him to dress a couple of otter-skins, thought it a great piece of nonsense, and was very near to forbidding him to go.</p> <p>When Walter came back from Rouen Herleva was up and about again, and he had scarcely set foot inside the hall when she pounced on him, asking a dozen questions at once, and wondering how he could have been away so long.</p> <p>&#x2018;It was not easy to come at my lord Count,' Walter explained, in his patient way. &#x2018;There are so many great seigneurs about him in the Castle at Rouen, and the pages would not let me pass the doors.'</p> <p>&#x2018;But you saw him?' Herleva said eagerly.</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, I saw him at last as he was on his way to a great hunting of deer.'</p> <p>At that Herleva broke in to ask how my lord had looked, and what spirits he was in, and what he had said when he heard the news. Walter answered all these questions as well as he was able, but he could only say that my lord looked much as he always did, which Herleva considered no answer at all. Then he fished out of his wallet a girdle of gold links set with matrix, and gave it to his sister, saying that my lord had sent it as a token of his love for her, and had bid him tell her to keep the child safe against his coming.</p> <p>But after all it was not until some time after the child's baptism that Count Robert came back to Hiesmes. Word was brought to Herleva that he had ridden into Falaise and up the Castle hill at the head of a great train of followers.</p> <p>At once Herleva and Duxia fell into a flurry of preparation, redding up the hall, strewing fresh rushes, and sweeping up the grey wood-ash that was blown over the floor from the fire of pine-logs in the middle of the ...</p></p><h2>HD Selected Poems</h2><p><p><strong>"Like every major artist she challenges the reader's intellect and imagination."&#x2015;<em>Boston Herald</em></strong></p><em>Selected Poems</em>, the first selection to encompass the rich diversity of Hilda Doolittle's poetry, is both confirmation and celebration of her long-overdue inclusion in the modernist canon.

From her early "Imagist" period, through the "lost" poems of the thirties where H.D. discovered her unique creative voice, to the great prophetic poems of the war years combined in <em>Trilogy</em>, the selection triumphantly concludes with portions of the late sequences <em>Helen in Egypt</em> and <em>Hermetic Definition</em> which focus on rebirth, reconciliation, and the reunion of the divided self.</p><p><p><strong>H.D.</strong> (1886-1961) (the pen name of Hilda Doolittle) was born in the Moravian community of Bethlehem, PA in 1886.

Whether you knit trendy garments or classic sweaters, the same techniques will make the difference between a garment that looks well made and one that doesn't. In this book, you will learn seven basic knitting techniques that greatly affect the appearance of a hand knit sweater: the smooth or bumpy side of the cast on edge on the public side of the garment, the placement and type of increases used in ribbing, slanting decreases, invisible increases, blocking, picking up stitches for bands, and buttonholes.<br> Master the "how" of each technique, then learn the "when, where and why." The author's goal is to give knitters information so they thoroughly understand the techniques and can confidently make choices about using them. This book is for knitters who know the basics and want to hone their skills to produce beautifully hand knit projects. This book has two sections:<br> 1. Seven Chapters<br> --Learn one technique per chapter with step-by-step instructions, clear illustrations, and detailed color photographs.<br> --Understand why each technique works and why it looks good.<br> --Receive lots of useful tips and hints for producing good results.<br> --Know the choices and options associated with the techniques.<br> 2. Seven Sweater Patterns<br> --A "tutorial project" (baby sweater) pattern is divided into sections that correspond to each chapter. The reader will be able to practice the lessons of each chapter on this real, but small, sweater.<br> --Six stylish adult sweater patterns provide plenty of opportunities to practice the techniques.<br> --All patterns have clear, row-by-row instructions.<br> --Information on sweater seaming is included in the appendix.<br> This is a skill-building, confidence-boosting book which shows knitters how to make even the simplest sweater look marvelous.</p><p>---This book focuses on seven simple things that Fisher has found to be the most common causes for sloppy results in sweaters. Seven simple things a manageable, tangible number that makes this book both approachable and extremely helpful. She doesn't attempt to teach you everything you may ever need to know about knitting. Just seven things that will produce results. <br> ---This clean, well-conceived book never strays from its purpose. Fisher makes a reasonable promise and she delivers on that promise. Read this book, and practice each new technique using the practice baby cardigan pattern, and you will gain knowledge that will make your next sweaters look better. Simple. <br> ---Her clean, factual writing style is infused with warmth and encouragement. She wants you to learn new options and understand why they work, but she never says, "You must do it this way."

The critical response that followed the publication of Stephen Meyer&#x2019;s book was fascinating, but the fact is that few&#x2014;if any&#x2014;of the critics really grappled with the crux of Meyer&#x2019;s argument or with the substance of intelligent-design theory.

Connie Willis lives with her family in Colorado.THE LAST OF THE WINNEBAGOS<br> &nbsp;<br> On the way out to Tempe I saw a dead jackal in the road. I was in the far left lane of Van Buren, ten lanes away from it, and its long legs were facing away from me, the squarish muzzle flat against the pavement so it looked narrower than it really was, and for a minute I thought it was a dog.<br> &nbsp;<br> I had not seen an animal in the road like that for fifteen years. They can&#x2019;t get onto the divideds, of course, and most of the multiways are fenced. And people are more careful of their animals.<br> &nbsp;<br> The jackal was probably somebody&#x2019;s pet. This part of Phoenix was mostly residential, and after all this time, people still think they can turn the nasty, carrion-loving creatures into pets. Which was no reason to have hit it and, worse, left it there. It&#x2019;s a felony to strike an animal and another one to not report it, but whoever had hit it was long gone.<br> &nbsp;<br> I pulled the Hitori over onto the center shoulder and sat there awhile, staring at the empty multiway. I wondered who had hit it and whether they had stopped to see if it was dead.<br> &nbsp;<br> Katie had stopped. She had hit the brakes so hard, she sent the car into a skid that brought it up against the ditch, and jumped out of the Jeep. I was still running toward him, floundering in the snow. We made it to him almost at the same time. I knelt beside him, the camera dangling from my neck, its broken case hanging half-open.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I hit him,&#x201d; Katie had said. &#x201c;I hit him with the Jeep.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I looked in the rearview mirror. I couldn&#x2019;t even see over the pile of camera equipment in the backseat with the eisenstadt balanced on top. I got out. I had come nearly a mile, and looking back, I couldn&#x2019;t see the jackal, though I knew now that&#x2019;s what it was.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;McCombe! David! Are you there yet?&#x201d; Ramirez&#x2019;s voice said from inside the car.<br> &nbsp;<br> I leaned in. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I shouted in the general direction of the phone&#x2019;s mike. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m still on the multiway.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mother of God, what&#x2019;s taking you so long? The governor&#x2019;s conference is at twelve, and I want you to go out to Scottsdale and do a layout on the closing of Taliessin West. The appointment&#x2019;s for ten. Listen, McCombe, I got the poop on the Amblers for you. They bill themselves as &#x2018;One Hundred Percent Authentic,&#x2019; but they&#x2019;re not. Their RV isn&#x2019;t really a Winnebago, it&#x2019;s an Open Road. It is the last RV on the road, though, according to Highway Patrol. A man named Eldridge was touring with one, also not a Winnebago, a Shasta, until March, but he lost his license in Oklahoma for using a tanker lane, so this is it. Recreation vehicles are banned in all but four states. Texas has legislation in committee, and Utah has a full-divided bill coming up next month. Arizona will be next, so take lots of pictures, Davey boy. This may be your last chance. And get some of the zoo.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What about the Amblers?&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Their name is Ambler, believe it or not. I ran a lifeline on them. He was a welder. She was a bank teller. No kids. They&#x2019;ve been doing this since eighty-nine when he retired. Nineteen years. David, are you using the eisenstadt?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We had been through this the last three times I&#x2019;d been on a shoot. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not there yet,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, I want you to use it at the governor&#x2019;s conference. Set it on his desk if you can.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I intended to set it on a desk, all right. One of the desks at the back, and let it get some nice shots of the rear ends of reporters as they reached wildly for a little clear airspace to shoot their pictures in, some of them holding their vidcams in their upstretched arms and aiming them in what they hope is the right direction because they can&#x2019;t see the governor at all, let it get a nice shot of one of the reporter&#x2019;s arms as he knocked it facedown on the desk.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This one&#x2019;s a new model. It&#x2019;s got a trigger. It&#x2019;s set for faces, full-lengths, and vehicles.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> So great. I come home with a hundred-frame cartridge full of passersby and tricycles. How the hell did it know when to click the shutter or which one the governor was in a press conference of eight hundred people, full-length or face? It was supposed to have all kinds of fancy light-metrics and computer-composition features, but all it could really do was mindlessly snap whatever passed in front of its idiot lens, just like the highway speed cameras.<br> &nbsp;<br> It had probably been designed by the same government types who&#x2019;d put the highway cameras along the road instead of overhead so that all it takes is a little speed to reduce the new side-license plates to a blur, and people go faster than ever. A great camera, the eisenstadt. I could hardly wait to use it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sun-Co&#x2019;s very interested in the eisenstadt,&#x201d; Ramirez said. She didn&#x2019;t say good-bye. She never does. She just stops talking and then starts up again later. I looked back in the direction of the jackal.<br> &nbsp;<br> The multiway was completely deserted. New cars and singles don&#x2019;t use the undivided multiways much, even during rush hours. Too many of the little cars have been squashed by tankers. Usually there are at least a few obsoletes and renegade semis taking advantage of the Patrol&#x2019;s being on the divideds, but there wasn&#x2019;t anybody at all.<br> &nbsp;<br> I got back in the car and backed up even with the jackal. I turned off the ignition but didn&#x2019;t get out. I could see the trickle of blood from its mouth from here. A tanker went roaring past out of nowhere, trying to beat the cameras, straddling the three middle lanes and crushing the jackal&#x2019;s rear half to a bloody mush. It was a good thing I hadn&#x2019;t been trying to cross the road. He never would have even seen me.<br> &nbsp;<br> I started the car and drove to the nearest off-ramp to find a phone. There was one at an old 7-Eleven on McDowell.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m calling to report a dead animal on the road,&#x201d; I told the woman who answered the Society&#x2019;s phone.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Name and number?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a jackal,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s between Thirtieth and Thirty-second on Van Buren. It&#x2019;s in the far right lane.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did you render emergency assistance?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There was no assistance to be rendered. It was dead.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did you move the animal to the side of the road?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; she said, her tone suddenly sharper, more alert.<br> &nbsp;<br> Because I thought it was a dog. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t have a shovel,&#x201d; I said, and hung up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Pieces of a Song: Selected Poems</h2><p><p>"Diane di Prima, revolutionary activist of the 1960s Beat literary renaissance, heroic in life and poetics: a learned humorous bohemian, classically educated and twentieth-century radical, her writing, informed by Buddhist equanimity, is exemplary in imagist, political and mystical modes.

Unfortunately, the poet's metaphysical and political visions become lost in meaningless abstractions or banal generalities expressing a naive dream of goodness (in "Revolutionary Letters": "Left to themselves people . . . share blankets, dope &amp; children / they are not lazy or afraid"). An overtly spiritual piece, "Paracelsus:" offers the image of a hallucinogenic "juice of stars / by circular stillation / smear / the inner man w/ the coction / till he burn / like worms of light in quicksilver." Of the many love poems, the most effective are those in which di Prima uses specific descriptive details to evoke particular moments unique to different relationships. In "Poem in Praise of My Husband (Taos)," she writes "I suppose it hasn't been easy living with me either . . . / but we cling to each other / as if each thought the other was the raft / and he adrift alone. . . ." Di Prima is at her best when concentrating on the subtle nuances and moods of human behavior. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Rough Guide to Kenya (Rough Guides)</h2><p><i>The Rough Guide to Kenya</i> has been the most authoritative guide to the country since it was first published in 1987.

This will likely stand as the definitive account of the New Guinea campaign.&#x201d;<i><i>&#x2014;The Christian Science Monitor&nbsp;</i></i></b><br><br>One American soldier called it &#x201c;a green hell on earth.&#x201d; Monsoon-soaked wilderness, debilitating heat, impassable mountains, torrential rivers, and disease-infested swamps&#x2014;New Guinea was a battleground far more deadly than the most fanatical of enemy troops. Japanese forces numbering some 600,000 men began landing in January 1942, determined to seize the island as a cornerstone of the Empire&#x2019;s strategy to knock Australia out of the war. Allied Commander-in-Chief General Douglas MacArthur committed 340,000 Americans, as well as tens of thousands of Australian, Dutch, and New Guinea troops, to retake New Guinea at all costs.<br><br> What followed was a four-year campaign that involved some of the most horrific warfare in history. At first emboldened by easy victories throughout the Pacific, the Japanese soon encountered in New Guinea a roadblock akin to the Germans&#x2019; disastrous attempt to take Moscow, a catastrophic setback to their war machine. For the Americans, victory in New Guinea was the first essential step in the long march towards the Japanese home islands and the ultimate destruction of Hirohito&#x2019;s empire. Winning the war in New Guinea was of critical importance to MacArthur. His avowed &#x201c;I shall return&#x201d; to the Philippines could only be accomplished after taking the island.<br><br> In this gripping narrative, historian James P. Duffy chronicles the most ruthless combat of the Pacific War, a fight complicated by rampant tropical disease, violent rainstorms, and unforgiving terrain that punished both Axis and Allied forces alike. Drawing on primary sources, <i>War at the End of the World</i> fills in a crucial gap in the history of World War II while offering readers a narrative of the first rank.</p><p><b>James P. Duffy</b> is the author of over a dozen previous books, most on military history. His World War II titles include <i>The Sinking of the Laconia and the U-Boat War</i>, <i>Target America</i>, and <i>Hitler's Secret Pirate Fleet</i>. He has also written on the American Civil War and the rulers of Imperial Russia. He resides with his family in New Jersey.&#x201c;A meaty, engrossing narrative history... This will likely stand as the definitive account of the New Guinea campaign.&#x201d;<b><i><i>&#x2014;The Christian Science Monitor&nbsp;</i></i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A vivid and well-researched chronicle of a 'forgotten fight' that was crucial to Allied victory...[<i>War at the End of the World</i>] gives those who were part of this forgotten fight the recognition they deserve.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;</b><i><b>The Wall Street Journal</b><br><br></i>&#x201c;This essential book adds insight and detail to a pivotal piece of the overshadowed war in the Pacific.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;</b><i><b>Library Journal</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;Historians will both admire and envy James P. Duffy&#x2019;s <i>War at the End of the World</i>, for he has done what so few of us can do: He has provided a dramatic and informative narrative history of an otherwise unknown but essential part of our history. Duffy&#x2019;s account of Douglas MacArthur&#x2019;s conquest of New Guinea restores to its proper place one of the greatest, and most brilliant, military campaigns in American history. Beautifully written and carefully researched, Duffy&#x2019;s narrative will now take its place as the standard history for a too-long-ignored campaign.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Mark Perry, Author of <i>The Most Dangerous Man in America:&nbsp;The Making of Douglas MacArthur</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Reaching deep into the jungles of New Guinea, James P. Duffy resurrects the spirit of MacArthur, Yamamoto, and the men who fought with rifle and bayonet for the Pacific War&#x2019;s pivotal island. With swift pace and an unerring sense of drama, <i>War at the End of the World</i> brings to life the brutal campaign that transformed General MacArthur from American hero to Allied conqueror.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Jonathan W. Jordan, <i>New York Times</i> Bestselling Author of <i>American Warlords </i>and&nbsp;<i>Brothers Rivals Victors</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In <i>War at the End of the World</i>, James P. Duffy has restored to the nation&#x2019;s memory a forgotten chapter of World War II, the four-year struggle for the world&#x2019;s largest island, New Guinea. At stake was the future of Australia and the reputation of America&#x2019;s best-known general, Douglas MacArthur. Don&#x2019;t miss this vivid, superbly narrated drama, which will leave you with a fresh reservoir of pride in our fighting&#x2014;and thinking&#x2014;soldiers.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Thomas Fleming, Author of <i>The Illusion of Victory: America in World War I</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;With stylish narration, James P. Duffy breathes new life into Douglas MacArthur&#x2019;s crucial but oft-overlooked campaign in the &#x2018;Green Hell&#x2019; of New Guinea. An excellent read.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Bruce Gamble, Author of </b><i><b>Invasion Rabaul&nbsp;</b><br><br></i>&#x201c;Duffy expertly unwinds the many disparate threads that make up wartime planning and communication, contrasting strategy with outcome and showing how the chain of command truly takes control in an otherwise chaotic situation.... An entertaining and well-researched war history that will satisfy intrigued novices and devoted students alike.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;</b><i><i><b>Kirkus</b><br></i><br> </i>&#x201c;Duffy makes a strong case that MacArthur&#x2019;s generalship is a major reason for the campaign&#x2019;s success.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;</b><i><i><b>Publishers Weekly</b><br></i><br></i>&#x201c;Duffy tells the story of this pivotal part of the war in clear prose and in great detail.&#x201d;<i><b>&#x2014;<i>The American Spectator</i></b>&nbsp;</i></p><h2>The Eclectic Abecedarium</h2><p>Edward Gorey&#39;s first miniature book, The Eclectic Abecedarium is an illustrated adventure through the English alphabet, accompanied by rhyming adventure through the English alphabet, accompanied by rhyming couplets penned by Gorey, who described his creations as &#34;literary nonsense.&#34; Inspired by popular moral primers for children, Gorey created an updated version of Isaac Watt&#39;s alphabetic adhorisms.

As a master storyteller and thinker John Berger challenges readers to rethink their every assumption about the role of creativity in our lives.<br><br> In this brilliant collection of diverse pieces&#x2014;essays, short stories, poems, translations&#x2014;which spans a lifetime&#x2019;s engagement with art, John Berger reveals how he came to his own unique way of seeing. He pays homage to the writers and thinkers who infuenced him, such as Walter Benjamin, Rosa Luxemburg and Bertolt Brecht. His expansive perspective takes in artistic movements and individual artists&#x2014;from the Renaissance to the present&#x2014;while never neglecting the social and political context of their creation.<br><br> Berger pushes at the limits of art writing, demonstrating beautifully how his artist&#x2019;s eye makes him a storyteller in these essays, rather than a critic. With &#x201c;landscape&#x201d; as an animating, liberating metaphor rather than a rigid defnition, this collection surveys the aesthetic landscapes that have informed, challenged and nourished John Berger&#x2019;s understanding of the world. <i>Landscapes</i>&#x2014;alongside <i>Portraits</i>&#x2014;completes a tour through the history of art that will be an intellectual benchmark for many years to come.</p><p>Storyteller, novelist, essayist, screenwriter, dramatist and critic, <b>John Berger</b> is one of the most internationally influential writers of the last fifty years. His many books include <i>Ways of Seeing</i>, the fiction trilogy<i> Into Their Labours, Here Is Where We Meet,</i> the Booker Prize winning novel <i>G, Hold Everything Dear, </i>the Man Booker&#x2013;long-listed<i> From A to X</i> and <i>A Seventh Man.</i> <br><br><b> Tom Overton</b> catalogued John Berger&#x2019;s archive at the British Library.

As he wrote recently: &#x2018;What has prompted me to write over the years is the hunch that something needs to be told and that if I don&#x2019;t try to tell it, it risks not being told.&#x2019; The humbleness of the word &#x2018;hunch&#x2019; in that statement tells you all you need to know.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;John Douglas Millar, <i>Frieze</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Essential reading not just for our political moment but outside it.

A graduate of Franklin &amp; Marshall College in 1941, he was one of the initial officers assigned to Easy Company of the 101st Airborne. Winters jumped into France on D-Day and commanded the unit now known as the Band of Brothers. Promoted to Captain and then battalion commander, he led his men through the Battle of the Bulge and captured Berchtesgaden, Hitler's Bavarian retreat. Released from military service in November 1945, he returned briefly to active duty during the Korean War, then spent his life on a small Pennsylvania farm and was a highly successful businessman. Now eighty-six years old, Winters is popular on the lecture circuit and has found the peace and quiet he promised himself as he lay down to catch some sleep on June 6, 1944&#x2014;D-Day.<br>Cole C. Kingseed is a thirty-year Army veteran who served in a variety of command and staff positions. He earned his M.A. in national security and strategic studies from the U.S. Naval War College and his Ph.D. in history from Ohio State. He taught at West Point, where he served as chief of military history for four years. Kingseed is the author of thirty-seven articles on corporate and military leadership and such books as <b>Eisenhower and the Suez Crisis of 1956</b> and <b>Old Glory Stories: Combat Leadership in World War II</b>. He is president of his own leadership consulting firm, The Brecourt Leadership Experience, Inc., whose clients, to name a few, include General Electric, FreddieMac, International Paper, and Bayer Corporation.In his well-intentioned but impersonal memoirs, Winters tells the tales left untold by Stephen Ambrose, whose Band of Brothers was the inspiration for the HBO miniseries, but Winters's memoir is disappointingly sparse on details unrelated to troop position. It is in the battles and tactical maneuvers of Easy Company that Winters is most at home: on D-Day, when Easy Company's commanding officer is killed, Winters takes charge minutes after landing deep in German territory and leads an assault against a German battery. He carefully explicates the reasoning behind his strategy, leading the reader along as the Company attacks German machine gun and mortar outposts. The narrative is laced with Winters's soldierly exaltations of pride in his comrades' bravery: "My God, it's beautiful when you think of a guy who was so dedicated to his company that he apologizes for getting hit." Although the intrepidness of the group induces more than a tinge of pride, the memoir is devoid of powerful reflections. In the last, sluggish chapters, Winters devotes an excessive amount of time to letters he has received and to expositions on leadership. Winters is too humble for a genre that requires a little bit of conceit.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Drawing upon massive research in diaries, letters, memoirs, and oral histories, the author argues that the lives of antebellum southern women, enslaved and free, differed fundamentally from those of northern women and that it is not possible to understand antebellum southern women by applying models derived from New England sources.<br><br></p><p>"Asks us to put aside simple generalizations and explore the complicated world that masters and slaves built together on their terms, not ours. . . . Fox-Genovese provides a rich analysis . . . without losing her critical eye or her amazing capacity for empathy. Like no other historian before or since."-- <i>Civil War Times</i> <br>This important book challenges many current notions about antebellum southern women, white and black. Bound in a web of intimacy fraught with violence, the lives of slave women were intertwined, but they were never linked in sisterhood. Although mistresses and slaves shared a common household, they were radically different from each other, and Within the Plantation Household documents the difficult class relations between slaveholding and slave women.</p><h2>Revelation (Life Lessons)</h2><p><p>Revised and updated, the Lucado Life Lessons series continues to be one of the best-selling study guide series on the market today.

She is a sensitive but astute young housekeeper who is entrusted to take care of him. Each morning, as the Professor and the Housekeeper are reintroduced to one another, a strange, beautiful relationship blossoms between them. The Professor may not remember what he had for breakfast, but his mind is still alive with elegant equations from the past. He devises clever maths riddles - based on her shoe size or her birthday - and the numbers reveal a sheltering and poetic world to both the Housekeeper and her ten-year-old son. With each new equation, the three lost souls forge an affection more mysterious than imaginary numbers, and a bond that runs deeper than memory.</p><p>Since 1988, Yoko Ogawa has written more than 20 works of fiction and non-fiction, and has won every major Japanese literary award. Her fiction has appeared in the New Yorker, A Public Space, and Zoetrope.<p>Of all the countless things my son and I learned from the Professor, the meaning of the square root was among the most important. No doubt he would have been bothered by my use of the word <em>countless--</em>too sloppy, for he believed that the very origins of the universe could be explained in the exact language of numbers--but I don&#x2019;t know how else to put it. He taught us about enormous prime numbers with more than a hundred thousand places, and the largest number of all, which was used in mathematical proofs and was in the <em>Guinness Book of Records</em>, and about the idea of something beyond infinity. As interesting as all this was, it could never match the experience of simply spending time with the Professor. I remember when he taught us about the spell cast by placing numbers under this square root sign. It was a rainy evening in early April. My son&#x2019;s schoolbag lay abandoned on the rug. The light in the Professor&#x2019;s study was dim. Outside the window, the blossoms on the apricot tree were heavy with rain. </p><p>The Professor never really seemed to care whether we figured out the right answer to a problem. He preferred our wild, desperate guesses to silence, and he was even more delighted when those guesses led to new problems that took us beyond the original one. He had a special feeling for what he called the &#x201c;correct miscalculation,&#x201d; for he believed that mistakes were often as revealing as the right answers. This gave us confidence even when our best efforts came to nothing. </p><p>&#x201c;Then what happens if you take the square root of negative one?&#x201d; he asked. </p><p>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;d need to get -1 by multiplying a number by itself?&#x201d; </p><p>Root asked. He had just learned fractions at school, and it had taken a half-hour lecture from the Professor to convince him that numbers less than zero even existed, so this was quite a leap. We tried picturing the square root of negative one in our heads: v-1. The square root of 100 is 10; the square root of 16 is 4; the square root of 1 is 1. So the square root of -1 is... </p><p>He didn&#x2019;t press us. On the contrary, he fondly studied our expressions as we mulled over the problem. </p><p>&#x201c;There is no such number,&#x201c; I said at last, sounding rather tentative. </p><p>&#x201c;Yes, there is,&#x201c; he said, pointing at his chest. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s in here. It&#x2019;s the most discreet sort of number, so it never comes out where it can be seen. But it&#x2019;s here.&#x201d; We fell silent for a moment, trying to picture the square root of minus one in some distant, unknown place. The only sound was the rain falling outside the window. My son ran his hand over his head, as if to confirm the shape of the square root symbol. </p><p>But the Professor didn&#x2019;t always insist on being the teacher. He had enormous respect for matters about which he had no knowledge, and he was as humble in such cases as the square root of negative one itself. Whenever he needed my help, he would interrupt me in the most polite way. Even the simplest request--that I help him set the timer on the toaster, for example--always began with &#x201c;I&#x2019;m terribly sorry to bother you, but...&#x201d; Once I&#x2019;d set the dial, he would sit peering in as the toast browned. He was as fascinated by the toast as he was by the mathematical proofs we did together, as if the truth of the toaster were no different from that of the Pythagorean theorem. </p><p>***</p><p>It was March of 1992 when the Akebono Housekeeping Agency first sent me to work for the Professor. At the time, I was the youngest woman registered with the agency, which served a small city on the Inland Sea, although I already had more than ten years of experience. I managed to get along with all sorts of employers, and even when I cleaned for the most difficult clients, the ones no other housekeeper would touch, I never complained. I prided myself on being a true professional. </p><p>In the Professor&#x2019;s case, it only took a glance at his client card to know that he might be trouble. A blue star was stamped on the back of the card each time a housekeeper had to be replaced, and there were already nine stars on the Professor&#x2019;s card, a record during my years with the agency. </p><p>When I went for my interview, I was greeted by a slender, elegant old woman with dyed brown hair swept up in a bun. She wore a knit dress and walked with a cane. </p><p>&#x201c;You will be taking care of my brother-in-law,&#x201c; she said. I tried to imagine why she would be responsible for her husband&#x2019;s brother. &#x201c;None of the others have lasted long,&#x201c; she continued. &#x201c;Which has been a terrible inconvenience for me and for my brother-in-law. We have to start again every time a new housekeeper comes.... The job isn&#x2019;t complicated. You would come Monday through Friday at 11:00 A.M., fix him lunch, clean the house, do the shopping, make dinner, and leave at 7:00 P.M. That&#x2019;s the extent of it.&#x201d; </p><p>There was something hesitant about the way she said the words brother-in-law. Her tone was polite enough, but her left hand nervously fingered her cane. Her eyes avoided mine, but occasionally I caught her casting a wary glance in my direction. </p><p>&#x201c;The details are in the contract I signed with the agency. I&#x2019;m simply looking for someone who can help him live a normal life, like anyone else.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Is your brother-in-law here?&#x201d; I asked. She pointed with the cane to a cottage at the back of the garden behind the house. A red slate roof rose above a neatly pruned hedge of scarlet hawthorn. </p><p>&#x201c;I must ask you not to come and go between the main house and the cottage. Your job is to care for my brother-in-law, and the cottage has a separate entrance on the north side of the property. I would prefer that you resolve any difficulties without consulting me. That&#x2019;s the one rule I ask you to respect.&#x201d; She gave a little tap with her cane. </p><p>I was used to absurd demands from my employers--that I wear a different color ribbon in my hair every day; that the water for tea be precisely 165 degrees; that I recite a little prayer every evening when Venus rose in the night sky--so the old woman&#x2019;s request struck me as relatively straightforward. </p><p>&#x201c;Could I meet your brother-in-law now?&#x201d; I asked. </p><p>&#x201c;That won&#x2019;t be necessary.&#x201d; She refused so flatly that I thought I had offended her. &#x201c;If you met him today, he wouldn&#x2019;t remember you tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He has difficulties with his memory,&#x201c; she said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not senile; his brain works well, but about seventeen years ago he hit his head in an automobile accident. Since then, he has been unable to remember anything new. His memory stops in 1975. He can remember a theorem he developed thirty years ago, but he has no idea what he ate for dinner last night. In the simplest terms, it&#x2019;s as if he has a single, eighty-minute videotape inside his head, and when he records anything new, he has to record over the existing memories. His memory lasts precisely eighty minutes--no more and no less.&#x201d; Perhaps because she had repeated this explanation so many times in the past, the old woman ran through it without pause, and with almost no sign of emotion. </p><p>How exactly does a man live with only eighty minutes of memory? I had cared for ailing clients on more than one occasion in the past, but none of that experience would be useful here. I could just picture a tenth blue star on the Professor&#x2019;s card. </p><p>From the main house, the cottage appeared deserted. An old-fashioned garden door was set into the hawthorn hedge, but it was secured by a rusty lock that was covered in bird droppings. </p><p>&#x201c;Well then, I&#x2019;ll expect you to start on Monday,&#x201c; the old woman said, putting an end to the conversation. And that&#x2019;s how I came to work for the Professor. </p><p>Copyright � 2003 by Yoko Ogawa; English translation copyright 2009 by Stephen Snyder.

In his role as a consultant, Professor Huck has worked on several projects, including (1) test-development efforts conducted by: the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine, the American Association of State Psychology Boards, Tennessee's State Departments of Education and Human Services, the Child Welfare Institute (Atlanta), and UT's Center for Government Training, (2) a three-year NSF research project designed to assess new procedures for helping math teachers assist students improve their creativity and problem-solving skills, and (3) a trial in which the State of Tennessee was being sued and for which Tennessee's Office of the Attorney General asked Dr. Huck to testify as an Expert Witness in the areas of testing, research design, and applied statistics. </p> <p>At various points in his career, Dr. Huck has received awards/recognition from students, colleagues, and administrators. While at DePauw, he received the Frank C. Tucker Award for Leadership. Early in his stay at Tennessee, the Student Government Association tapped him as one of the University's Outstanding Teachers. Soon thereafter, colleagues at UT gave him the first Annual Award for Outstanding Faculty Research in the College of Education. The major honors bestowed upon Professor Huck, however, came (1) in 1983 when he was selected to be a UT Distinguished Service Professor, a prestigious title that he holds for the duration of his stay at the University, (2) in 1988 when he was asked to serve, for a year, on the faculty at the Air Force Academy as a Distinguished Visiting Professor, (3) in 1984 and 1990 when the scholarly work of two doctoral advisees received Outstanding Dissertation Awards in national competitions conducted by AERA, (4) in 1991 when he was elected by his colleagues at other universities as President of AERA's Educational Statisticians SIG, (5) in 1993 when he was one of the first two faculty members given the title of Chancellor's Teaching Scholar, a post involving work with UT's Chancellor and other top administrators, and (6) in 1995 when the GTA Mentoring Program (a project that grew out of his idea on how to improve undergraduate education at research universities) was deemed worthy of support by UT and the Alcoa Foundation. </p></p><h2>Exploring the Building Blocks of Science Book 1 Student Textbook (softcover)</h2><p>Introduce early learners to real science with the Exploring the Building Blocks of Science Book 1 Student Textbook.

She was then awarded a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of New Mexico, followed by a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. As Dr. Keller home schooled her three children, she was unable to find science textbooks that she felt would give her children a solid foundation in the sciences. Her scientific background, coupled with her desire to educate her children, led Dr. Keller to found Gravitas Publications, Inc. and to develop the Real Science-4-Kids curriculum. Real Science-4-Kids is a &#34;worldview-neutral&#34; curriculum that provides students with a solid foundation in the sciences and also gives them the tools to evaluate scientific data on their own. Students are presented with up-to-date scientific facts and the steps of the scientific method, together with the critical thinking tools needed to help them evaluate scientific conclusions. Dr. Keller&#39;s books are as philosophically neutral as possible and do not impose any single overall philosophical interpretation such as Darwinism, Intelligent Design, or Creationism. Instead, they allow students to make up their own minds about what the data show. Real Science-4-Kids, with its engaging, kid-friendly text and easy to use teacher-friendly manuals, is used in home, private, and public schools in all 50 states in the US and in many other countries. Dr. Keller&#39;s publishing team continues to develop and test products at her Albuquerque headquarters.

Marsh Novel)</h2><p><b>"John McMahon is one of those rare writers who seem to have sprung out of nowhere. His first novel, <i>The Good Detective</i>, which is pretty much perfect, features a decent if flawed hero battling personal troubles while occupied with a murder case of great consequence to his community."--<b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>Introducing Detective P.T. Marsh in a swift and bruising debut where Elmore Leonard's staccato prose meets Greg Iles' Southern settings.<br><br><i>How can you solve a crime if you've killed the prime suspect?</i></b><br><br>Detective P.T. Marsh was a rising star on the police force of Mason Falls, Georgia--until his wife and young son died in an accident. Since that night, he's lost the ability to see the line between smart moves and disastrous decisions. Such as when he agrees to help out a woman by confronting her abusive boyfriend. When the next morning he gets called to the scene of his newest murder case, he is stunned to arrive at the house of the very man he beat up the night before. He could swear the guy was alive when he left, but can he be sure? What's certain is that his fingerprints are all over the crime scene. <br><br>The trouble is only beginning. When the dead body of a black teenager is found in a burned-out field with a portion of a blackened rope around his neck, P.T. realizes he might have killed the number-one suspect of this horrific crime.<br><br>Amid rising racial tension and media scrutiny, P.T. uncovers something sinister at the heart of the boy's murder--a conspiracy leading all the way back to the time of the Civil War. Risking everything to unravel the puzzle even as he fights his own personal demons, P.T. races headlong toward an incendiary and life-altering showdown.</p><p><b>John McMahon</b> studied Creative Writing at The University of Arizona.

He currently lives in Southern California with his family and two rescue animals.1 <br><br> A fist banged on my driver's-side window, and my eyes flew open. I lunged for my Glock 42. Nearly shot my foot off.<br>Two white eyeballs glared at me through the darkness.<br>Horace Ordell.<br>"You okay, P.T.?" he hollered.<br>The first thing you gotta know about Horace is that his ass is the size of a small nation. So to get him moving takes an act of war.<br>I looked at the clock in my Ford F-150: 2:47 a.m.<br>"You were screaming in your sleep," Horace said. The big man's body was parked a foot outside my door. "Could hear you way the hell yonder."<br>My eyes drifted to the bouncer's stool where Horace resided most nights. A neon sign above it read The Landing Patch, and two curved strips of light displayed what very unsubtly looked like a woman's legs, opening and closing. And opening and closing again.<br>I took in the smell of tobacco plants after the rain. The scent of old Georgia dirt.<br>"Everything all right inside the club?" I asked, opening my truck door.<br>Horace bobbed his bald head, his skin dark as night. He'd played O-line for Alabama until he blew out his knee.<br>Behind him, the strip club was housed in an old log mill, set along protected county land beside the Tullumy River. What were once windows for ventilation had been covered with rusted metal signs to block out the light. Drink Coca-Cola, one read. Eat Utz Chips, another.<br>I glanced at myself in the rearview mirror before getting out. Wavy brown hair. Bloodshot blue eyes.<br>I also saw into the back of the cab, where Purvis lay. Sweet Purvis, my seven-year-old bulldog. The look he gave me lately was always the same: You're spiraling since she's gone, P.T. Grab ahold of something.<br>But I'm not the type to reach out and grab. Hugs, for instance. I was never a big hugger. Even before my wife's accident.<br>I stepped out of the truck, and Horace kept yammering.<br>"I don't mean you were screaming a little, P.T.," he said. "It was more like History Channel, Army flashback type shit."<br>"You can go back to your post, Horace," I said. "I'm fine."<br>Of course I wasn't fine. I was five counties from fine.<br>Horace stared at the ground, his mind hatching something. "Or I could call someone?"<br>The look on his face was odd. A nervous smirk maybe. "Like who?" I said.<br>"I dunno." He shrugged. "Another cop? I know you had a couple drinks. Maybe he comes out here and has you walk the line. Throws some cuffs on you?" He hesitated. "Or you could tip me? A lotta folks tip me."<br>I almost smiled. A shit-heel like Horace threatening a detective who'd experienced what I'd been through. If brains were leather, this guy didn't have enough to saddle a june bug.<br>I reached into my truck, and Horace took a cautious step back. Then he saw the highball glass in my hand. I'd brought it out earlier from the Landing Patch, and it was still full.<br>I handed him the glass and got back in the truck. The night sky was a shade of violet, with purplish-gray cumulus clouds that looked like overstuffed pillows.<br>"Here's a tip," I said to Horace, "don't go mistaking grief for weakness."<br>I fired up the engine, and a paper crinkled in my flannel shirt pocket under my seat belt. Unfolding it, I stared at a single word as Horace walked away.<br>Crimson.<br>The penmanship was as neat as could be expected, considering it had been written in eyeliner and penned in the dark.<br>I flipped the paper over. The other side had an address on it: 426 E. 31st. 'B.'<br>"Damn it," I said, remembering the stripper and her story from the previous night. She was a redhead with bruises that ran the length of both legs. I had promised her I'd come by and flash my badge. Scare the shit out of her abusive boyfriend.<br>My eyeballs were floating, and I needed to find a bathroom. I pulled onto I-32.<br>My name is P.T. Marsh, and Mason Falls, Georgia, is my town. It's not a huge place, but it's grown a decent size in the last decade. Lately we top out around 130,000 souls. A lot of that growth has come from two airlines setting up shop here as a place where they refurbish commercial airplanes. The bulk of those planes get repainted and sold to overseas airlines you've never heard of. But some of them end up right back in the friendly skies above. It's kind of like plastic surgery in the better neighborhoods of Buckhead. Slap on a fresh coat of paint and some new carpet, and no one notices how worn-out the bodies are underneath.<br>I made it through the cute areas of town. The parts where, during the day, tourists window-shop for Civil War-era vases. Where college kids eat chicken-fried steak and get drunk on buckets of Terrapin Rye.<br>The numbered streets came then, and along with them, the parts of town where folks lived who worked on those airplanes. The scrubbers, recarpeters, and painters.<br>I passed 15th Street, 20th, 25th. It had rained while I was asleep at the Landing Patch, and small lakes formed in poorly paved side streets.<br>I parked my truck behind an abandoned Big Lots off 30th and got out, cutting through the dark neighborhood on foot.<br>After a few minutes, I found the address on the paper, a worn-down bungalow home. The letter B and an arrow had been spray-painted on the driveway, pointing at a detached back unit.<br>Crimson's place.<br>Small white Christmas lights were on in one window, the only sign of the coming holiday. I walked closer. The bedroom had an entrance that led in from the driveway. Through the screen door, I could see Crimson, faceup on the bed.<br>The redhead lay there in cutoff jeans and a V-neck with no bra. Her cheeks showed fresh bruises, and her T-shirt bore the face of a Georgia bulldog in pink. I had told her that I'd come by official, with a squad car, a day earlier.<br>Don't make promises you can't keep, P.T.<br>It was Purvis's voice that I heard. Of course, he's a brown and white bulldog with a bad underbite, and I'd left him back in the truck by the Big Lots. So maybe it was my voice and his face. The subconscious works in strange ways. Or is that God?<br>I made my way inside, hurrying to see if Crimson was alive. I leaned over and checked her pulse. She'd been knocked to hell and back, but her breathing was fine.<br>I shook her awake, and it took a moment for her to recognize me.<br>"Your boyfriend here?" I asked.<br>In the dim light, she pointed to the living room. "He's sleeping."<br>"You got a friend you can stay with for a couple hours? Let me talk some sense into him?"<br>Crimson nodded, grabbing her sweatshirt and purse.<br>I moved to the living room, and my eyes adjusted to the dark. Crimson's boyfriend was passed out in a sitting pose on the couch in a dirty tank top and jeans.<br>A brick of weed sat on a wooden table by the couch, and one of the boyfriend's hands was wrapped in gauze. A strip of dried blood was smeared across the fabric.<br>So here's the thing.<br>You spend the first thirty-six years of your life learning a value system. What's right. What's wrong. And when to say "To hell with it" and toss the rules aside.<br>But you accumulate things too. A house. A mortgage. A wife and kid. And somewhere along the way, those responsibilities matter more than right and wrong. Because there's consequences. Doing absolute right can create problems for you and your family. For your career.<br>For me, that was the road I'd been on. A beautiful wife. Young son. And I'd been as happy as a pig in shit going down that path.<br>But someone came along and took my responsibilities away. Took away my family. And all they left me with was absolute justice.<br>I ran my flashlight over the boyfriend's chest. He looked to be in his early thirties. A muscle-bound five foot nine. Shaved head and a blond goatee. A tattoo on his biceps read 88. The eighth letter of the alphabet, H. Two H's, for Heil Hitler.<br>So you're a neo-Nazi who beats up strippers.<br>The man's mouth was open, and a bead of drool hung down from the corner of it. A half-empty bottle of Jack was curled under his right arm.<br>I sat down on an armchair a foot from him. Grabbed a dish towel nearby and wrapped the soft cloth around my fist.<br>"Hey, dipshit," I said.<br>His eyes fluttered open, and he sat up. A look to the bedroom. Maybe he had a gun there. Or maybe he was wondering if I'd seen the condition he'd left Crimson in.<br>"Who the hell are you?" he mumbled, disoriented. He smelled like pomade and tobacco.<br>"Don't worry," I said. "The cops are here."<br>2<br>I punched him hard, square in the face.<br>"Jesus," he said, holding his hand to his nose. Blood surged through his fingers and onto his shirt.<br>He glared at me, waking up now. "Y'all just can't break into people's houses-"<br>I hit him again. The first time was for Crimson, the second for emphasis. His head popped backward and hit the couch.<br>"What do you want?" He sniffed. A stripe of blood across his teeth.<br>I looked around the place, taking in every detail.<br>There was a time when the Mason Falls Register called me "a detective who missed nothing." And then a more recent time when a case didn't go so well and they used the word "sloppy." I guess you can't stay on top forever.<br>"Your full attention," I said.<br>The boyfriend was still playing defense. He glanced at a frog gig leaning against the far wall. Maybe he was fixin' to stick me with the two-pronged pole.<br>I picked up a lighter from off the table. Lit the corner of the brick of pot on fire.<br>"The people that belongs to," he said, "they won't care who the hell you are-"<br>"Shhh." I bent forward and laid the head of my Glock against his jeans, right at the kneecap. "Do I have your undivided attention?"<br>"Yeah," he said, and I tapped the gun on his knee.<br>"You touch her one more time." I pointed at the bedroom. "One more tiny bruise on her, and I will take that bloody fist of yours and blow each finger off. One at a time. Like target practice. Y'understand?"<br>He nodded slowly, and I got up. Walked out.<br>3<br>I got the call at eight a.m. while I was still sleeping.<br>"We got a hot one," Remy Morgan said.<br>Remy is my partner, and I often tell her that she smells like milk. This is my joke that she's young. Like twenty-five years young. She's also African American, so sometimes she warns me, "Don't say chocolate milk, P.T., or I'll beat your ass."<br>I pulled the covers off my head. "What's the case?" I asked hoarsely into my cell phone. I was still wearing my jeans, but no T-shirt or flannel.<br>"We got a dead guy," Remy said.<br>I looked around for my shirt, but didn't see it. Shook Purvis from atop my legs. This would be Remy's third murder case, and I could hear that rookie detective excitement in her voice. "Dead good guy or dead bad guy?"<br>"Dead bad guy," she said. "And probably beaten to death by other bad guys. I'll come get you."<br>I was out of the shower in five minutes. Pulled on gray slacks and tucked in a white button-down.<br>Cracking open the fridge, I looked for something to eat. I was developing a new diet that involved stale food, mold, and a lot of instant hot cereal. I could feel a bestseller coming. Or maybe it was a stomach flu.<br>A car beeped outside, and I glanced through the blue curtains that my wife, Lena, had put up before Thanksgiving of last year. That was four weeks before the accident.<br>Remy's '77 Alfa Romeo Spider was at the curb. I hurried out and squeezed into the passenger seat.<br>"Where's the scene?" I asked.<br>"Numbered streets," she said.<br>It sprinkled as we drove, and the trees in the median along Baker Street drooped under the weight of the water. Remy told me about an extreme mud run that she'd won second place in during the weekend.<br>"You don't get enough excitement being a cop during the week?" I asked. "You gotta pay someone to get you dirty and let off fake explosions?"<br>Remy scrunched her brow. She had the sculpted cheekbones of a fashion model. "Don't be an old man, P.T."<br>I knew how competitive Remy was. "Well, if you came in second, who won the thing?"<br>"Some fireman from Marietta."<br>Remy shrugged before letting out a smile. "He won twice actually. I gave him my number."<br>I grinned at this, cranking down my window. The wet weather had begun Sunday, and the humidity in between thunderstorms had bleached the blue out of the Georgia sky and made everything a dull military gray.<br>As we approached 30th Street, I saw the Big Lots where I'd parked the night before, and a lump started to form in my throat. Partly because I don't believe in coincidences. But mostly because there are no coincidences.<br>We pulled in front of Crimson's house on 31st, and I gulped at the humid air coming in the window. The house looked even worse in daylight. More paint had peeled off the facade than was on it.<br>Remy got out of the car. She had on a pin-striped blouse and black slacks. She tries to dress down how good she looks with these bookish glasses and business suits. But between the two of us, we're the best-looking pair of detectives in town. Of course, in the area of homicide, there's only one other set, but hey.<br>Remy handed me blue latex gloves, and we walked up the driveway. I passed the letter B and the arrow.<br>"The victim's male or female?" I asked.<br>"Male," Remy said. "Twenty-nine years old."<br>When you left here, P.T., he was alive.<br>Quiet, Purvis. I need to concentrate.<br>"We got any witnesses who saw the murder?" I asked.<br>"Not so far," Remy said. "But the day's young. We haven't canvassed yet."<br>I looked around. The next-door neighbor's house had plywood covering the side windows. There were thick dark knots soaked with rain that caused the wood to bow.<br>I nodded to Darren Gattling, who stood by the front door. Darren's a blue-suiter who I'd mentored five years earlier.</p><h2>Fantastic Mr. Dahl</h2><p>Just how did Roald Dahl get into writing? Where did he get his ideas from?

She answered the door with a thin frown of surprise. She wasn't expecting me. We had never met.<br><br>"My name is Roman Osipovich Markin," I said. "The brother of your husband."<br><br>She nodded and ran her hand along the worn pleat of a gray skirt as she stood aside to allow me in. If the mention of Vaska startled her, she hid it well.

Soon it will be a box. Then boxes."<br><br>"Surely you haven't come only to describe the state of your office?"<br><br>"I am here to do my brother a final service," I said.<br><br>"And that is?" she asked.<br><br>My vertebrae cinched together. My hands felt much too large for my pockets. It's a terrible thing, really, when said aloud. "To ensure that his misfortune doesn't become a family trait."<br><br>She gathered every photograph she had of Vaska, as I asked. Nine in total. A marriage portrait. A day in the country. One taken the day they moved to the city, their first act as Leningraders. One of Vaska as a boy. She sat down on the divan and showed each to her boy for a final time before bringing them to the bedroom.<br><br>She arrayed them on the desk. Her bedroom was mainly bare floor. The bed still wide enough for three, the blanket neatly pulled over a flabby mass of pillows. She must have only shared it with her son now.<br><br>I slid a one-ruble coin across the desk, hammer-and-sickle side up.<br><br>"What am I to do with this?"<br><br>I nodded at the photos. "You know what to do."<br><br>She shook her head, and with a sweep of her forearm that sent a small galaxy of dust motes into orbit, she winged the coin to the floor.<br><br>Could she have still loved my brother? Hard to believe. He'd been proven guilty of religious radicalism by an impartial and just tribunal. He'd received the only sentence suitable for a madman who poisoned others with the delusion that heaven awaits us. Paradise is possible only here on earth, possible only if we engineer it. One shouldn't envy this woman's blind devotion to a man who has proven himself unworthy of love. One mustn't.<br><br>She pressed her palms over the photographs, threw her elbows out to shield the images with her broad back, an instinct that suggested a starving creature protecting her last morsels, and this may be true: The stomach is not the only vital organ that hungers.<br><br>"Leave," she said, a ragged edge to her voice. She stared at the back of her hands. "Leave us be."<br><br>I could have turned, walked out of the room, closed the door on the whole affair. I'd done more than was required already. But something kept my heels pinned to the floorboards. Even though the concept of family was slipping into history as swiftly as the horse and carriage, I didn't have a wife or child of my own, and I wanted someone who shared my blood to live to see that paradise we've given ourselves to achieve. I wanted that little fellow out there on the divan to grow up, to become an active builder of communism, to look back on his life when he is a fat and happy old man, to know that the faultless society surrounding him justifies his father's death, and then, to be grateful for the lesson taught by the uncle he briefly met on a cold winter morning a lifetime ago.<br><br>It's silly. I know.<br><br>I grabbed her wrist and pinched the coin between her fingers.<br><br>"I'm not here to hurt you," I told her. "I'm here to make sure you don't get hurt. Your husband was an enemy of the people. What do you think will happen if NKVD men search the flat and find all these photographs? Must I go into greater detail?"<br><br>Whatever naked sentiment splayed itself across the table recoiled within her. She kept hold of the coin when I let go. That coin could have bought a meat pie, a sketch pad, a confectionary, a bar of soap; pressed into someone else's palm it could have become the bright spot in a dull day, but coins cannot choose their fate.<br><br>"Why can't you do it? You're the artist. This is your job."<br><br>I checked my watch. "I don't begin work for another hour."<br><br>When I heard the slow scratch of the coin on photo paper, I turned away. In the living room, the boy sat quietly peering at the thin lines etched upon his palms.<br><br>It was uncanny how much he resembled his father. A nose he hadn't yet grown into; a messy thatch of black hair, each follicle aimed in a different direction; lips pursed as small as a button. I would have been eight when Vaska was his age. Summer days we roamed the forests and fields, and at night we tapped coded messages to each other through the wall between our rooms; we each had our own. I made him sit for me in every shade and season of light so that I could sketch his likeness, could preserve his expression in charcoal on the page. If not for Vaska, I would have never become an artist. His face was my apprenticeship.<br><br>"Do you speak?" I asked.<br><br>He nodded.<br><br>"With understatement, I see. Tell me your name."<br><br>"Vladimir."<br><br>I clasped his shoulder and he flinched, surprised by the sudden gesture of affection. He shared his first name with Lenin--an auspicious sign.<br><br>"I want to see if you can do something for me," I asked. "Are you willing to try?"<br><br>He nodded.<br><br>"Stare straight at me," I instructed, then I flashed my fingers by his ear. "How many am I holding up?"<br><br>He held up four fingers.<br><br>"Very good. You've got keen eyes. Someday you might be a sharpshooter or a watchman. I'm going to tell you the story of the tsar and the painting. Have you heard it?"<br><br>The coin scratching in the bedroom might have been wind rustling leaves; we might have been far from there, near a dacha, in a field, the sun burning just over our heads.<br><br>"No, I didn't think you would have," I said. "It begins with a young man who overthrows an evil tsar. The young man becomes the new tsar. He promises his subjects that their troubles will disappear if they obey him. 'What will this new kingdom look like?' his subjects ask. The tsar considers it and then commissions his court painters to paint a picture of what the new kingdom will look like.<br><br>"First the painting is only a few paces wide, then a few dozen paces, then hundreds of paces. Soon the painting is miles and miles wide. Now, this is a big painting, no? Raw materials are essential to its success. The flax that would have clothed the tsar's subjects is requisitioned for the canvas. The wood that would have built houses is requisitioned for the frame.<br><br>"When the subjects are cold, the tsar tells them to look at the painting and see the beautiful coats and furs they will soon wear. When they sleep outside, he tells them to look at the painting and see the beautiful homes they will soon live in.<br><br>"The subjects obey the tsar. They know that if they turn their eyes from the painting and see what is around them, if they see the world as it is, the tsar will make them disappear in a big poof of smoke. Soon, all his subjects are frozen in place, unable to move, just like their reflections in the painting."<br><br>The boy stared with a bored frown. He must have been accustomed to excellent storytelling. Literature for children receives less attention from the censors than literature for adults, so naturally our best writers flock to the genre.<br><br>"How many fingers am I holding up?" I asked.<br><br>He put up three.<br><br>I slid my hand farther into his periphery. "How many now?"<br><br>He put up one.<br><br>"And now?"<br><br>He began turning his head, but I snapped. "Eyes ahead. Just like people in a painting can't turn their heads to see who's behind them, neither can you."<br><br>"I can't see how many fingers," he said. "Your hand is too far back."<br><br>"That's right," I said. "That's where your father is. He's there, painted in the background, back behind your head, where you can't see. He's there, but you can never turn to look."<br><br>The coin scratching had silenced some time ago. When I looked up, the boy's mother was standing in the bedroom doorway. I followed her in. The photographs were lined neatly on the desk. In each one, a single face had been so violently scratched out that the desk's wood grain was visible through the hole. My eyes ached to see it. I closed them.<br><br>"Get photographs of your son every year," I advised. "If you're arrested, he'll be placed in a state orphanage who knows where. With a recent photograph, you'll have a better chance of finding him."<br><br>I was already at the door when she grabbed my wrist and turned me around.<br><br>"You're not finished," she said. "You owe my husband more."<br><br>"This is the best I can do."<br><br>Her hand was on my neck. The boy just sat there, across the room, watching with dark, dumb eyes. What did he see when he saw me? You remain the hero of your own story even when you become the villain of someone else's. His mother's chest indented on my forearm.<br><br>"You're in the party," she insisted. "Do something. Move us somewhere."<br><br>"I correct images. That's it."<br><br>"Then what more can we do? Tell me. When they go into an orphanage you never find them."<br><br>Her eyes were webbed with pink and her hands cupped my cheeks, her middle fingers tucked under my earlobes. There was something foreign in the hard, dense heat of her breath on my face. I couldn't recall the last time someone had breathed on me, nor the last time I had felt needed.<br><br>"You prove your loyalty," I said quietly. "That can work. In my own experience it has worked."<br><br>She looked to the boy, then took my hand. She led me past him, toward the bedroom, toward the bed still wide enough for two. All I wanted was to get out, to be rid of these people. Even so it was a relief to see that she would take her dead husband's brother to the bedroom, a relief to know that the boy might live to become that fat and happy old man because his mother understood, as his father never had, that it is not God or gravity but grace of the state that holds us upon the earth.<br><br>I shook my hand from her grip. She turned, uncertain. I leaned toward her, so the boy wouldn't overhear.<br><br>"You prove loyalty through betrayal." The words traveled no farther than the length of a little finger, from my lips to her ear. "You inform on someone close to you. This is what I know works."<br>Two years have passed since that morning. A month ago the department requisitioned my small office. A mean sense of humor, if little else, has filled the vacancy between my superior's ears: He has assigned me to continue our necessary work underground. Several hundred feet underground.<br><br>I bid the sky farewell and climb down. Amid dim electric bulbs, I imagine myself contracting within shadow, becoming Caravaggian. No matter how early I arrive, the workmen are already here: laying rail track, reinforcing tunnel cement, never raising their wary eyes to mine. I enter a sawdust swarm and on the other side emerge at the door of what will be the stationmaster's office.<br><br>Maxim, my assistant, has beaten me here. The worktable is already prepared with nozzles, cylinders of pressurized air, paint, sealed directives, and stacked files of uncorrected photographs.<br><br>Our Younger Stalins cabinet stands in the corner. It holds photographs of our vozhd taken ten to twenty years ago. When possible, we substitute a Younger Stalin for current ones. It's essential we convey to the people the youthful vigor of their elder statesman. The longer we do it, the further back in time we must go to find new material. Readers of certain periodicals may worry that he is growing younger with each passing year; by his seventieth birthday he will be a slender-faced adolescent.<br><br>"You're late, Comrade," Maxim says, speaking of slender-faced adolescents. The day we met, when the Department of Party Propaganda and Agitation first assigned him as my assistant, was the last day he saluted me. He sends letters praising the party leadership with the hope that the police will intercept, read, and record his expressions of loyalty. He makes no secret of wanting my post.<br><br>"I'm old, Comrade," I say.<br><br>Maxim, the little brute, nods in agreement.<br><br>By lunch we have corrected by airbrush three faces from a 1930 Foreign Trade Committee portrait that has been retouched so many times it's more painting than photograph. Or I should say, I have; Maxim contributes only cigarette smoke and a sour smirk. While concentrating on the face beneath my airbrush, I glance up to find Maxim concentrating on mine. The little brute couldn't erase pencil lead.<br><br>We lunch alone. Maxim stays in the mercury-vapor brightness of the office, while I wander through the tunnels. I have walked for hours through these tunnels and have found no end to them. Someday trains will carry the grateful citizens of a socialist paradise through this netherworld. All the work we have done here in their name will then be justified.</p><h2>Bookbinding: Its Background and Technique (Two Volumes Bound as One)</h2><p><p>Edith Diehl (1876&#x2013;1955) was one of the world's foremost practitioners of traditional bookbinding and an exceptionally able teacher. From the vantage point of a lifetime's experience, she gives today's bookbinders a historical survey of this centuries-old art and an eminently practical guide.<br>Nearly one half of the encyclopedic volume is devoted to an overview of the historical development of bookbinding. The author shows how the codex form of the book became identified with the Christian era, how bookbinding became a craft and trade in the 15th century, and how the production and distribution of books shifted from the monasteries and universities to the illustrious printer-publishers of the 15th and 16th centuries. She describes various bookbinding practices such as sewing, the use of boards and leathers, hand versus machine binding, cased books, etc. And she examines in depth the different national styles of book decoration in Italy, France, England, Germany, North America, and other countries, and the specific contributions of such influential bookbinders as Jean Grolier, Thomas Mahieu, Le Gascon, Samuel Mearne, Roger Payne, Jacob Krause, Edmund Ranger, and John Ratcliff. Ninety-two full-page plates provide visualization of certain key points and, above all, numerous examples of the finest decorated bindings.<br>Edith Diehl then guides the reader through more than 400 profusely illustrated pages on the craft of hand bookbinding. She details and illustrates the steps involved in the nearly 30 necessary binding operations: collating and paging, pulling and removing glue, guarding and mending, pressing, sewing, backing, lacing-in, headbanging, lining up back, casing texts in protective cover, covering, cutting inside margins and filling in, and many more. In addition she conveys much useful information on such ancillary topics as doublures, fly-leaves, half bindings, limp bindings, vellum bindings, slipcases, repairing old bindings, cleaning and washing papers, materials (leather, paper, gold leaf, glue, paste), finishing tools, tooling, lettering, etc. The 242 illustrations that accompany this book-within-a-book are unmatched for economy and clarity.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Shaping Text: Type, Typography and the Reader</h2><p><p><i>Shaping Text</i> takes a practical and broad approach to typography.

Weyl focuses on eight artists&#x2014;Louise Bourgeois, Minna Citron, Worden Day, Dorothy Dehner, Sue Fuller, Alice Trumbull Mason, Louise Nevelson, and Anne Ryan&#x2014;who bent the technical rules of printmaking and blazed new aesthetic terrain with their etchings, engravings, and woodcuts. She reveals how Atelier 17 operated as an uncommonly egalitarian laboratory for revolutionizing print technique, style, and scale. It facilitated women artists&#x2019; engagement with modernist styles, providing a forum for extraordinary achievements that shaped postwar sculpture, fiber art, neo-Dadaism, and the Pattern and Decoration movement. Atelier 17 fostered solidarity among women pursuing modernist forms of expression, providing inspiration for feminist collective action in the 1960s and 1970s. <i>The Women of Atelier 17</i> also identifies for the first time nearly 100 women, many previously unknown, who worked at the studio, and provides incisive illustrated biographies of selected artists.</p><p>This timely reexamination of the experimental New York print studio Atelier 17 focuses on the women whose work defied gender norms through novel aesthetic forms and techniques.<p><b>Christina Weyl</b> is an independent scholar who focuses on American printmaking and women artists.</p></p><h2>Death Comes to the Nursery (A Kurland St. Mary Mystery)</h2><p><i>Delighted by the quiet uproar of raising their newborn, Lady Lucy and Major Sir Robert Kurland could not be more pleased at the prospect of welcoming another into their home.

The military successes of European imperialism are easy to explain because in many cases they were achieved by using firearms against spears. Alfred Crosby, however, explains that the Europeans&#39; displacement and replacement of the native peoples in the temperate zones was more a matter of biology than of military conquest. Now in a new edition with a new preface, Crosby revisits his classic work and again evaluates the ecological reasons for European expansion. Alfred W. Crosby is the author of the widely popular and ground-breaking books,The Measure of Reality (Cambridge, 1996), and America&#39;s Forgotten Pandemic (Cambridge, 1990).

For example, hidden Markov models are used for analyzing biological sequences, linguistic-grammar-based probabilistic models for identifying RNA secondary structure, and probabilistic evolutionary models for inferring phylogenies of sequences from different organisms. This book gives a unified, up-to-date and self-contained account, with a Bayesian slant, of such methods, and more generally to probabilistic methods of sequence analysis. Written by an interdisciplinary team of authors, it is accessible to molecular biologists, computer scientists, and mathematicians with no formal knowledge of the other fields, and at the same time presents the state of the art in this new and important field.</p><p>Probabilistic methods are assuming greater significance in the analysis of nucleotide sequence data.

Originally issued in 1963 as a limited-edition set of commentary and 150 silkscreened color plates, the book introduced generations of students, artists, designers, and collectors to Albers&#x2019;s unique approach to complex principles.&nbsp;While the original publication has long been out of print, this beautiful new edition now brings <i>Interaction </i>back into classrooms, studios, and onto bookshelves, where it will find an eager new audience. Lavishly produced as a two volume slipcased set, this book replicates Albers&#x2019;s revolutionary exercises, explaining concepts such as color relativity and vibrating and vanishing boundaries through the use of color, shape, die-cut forms, and movable flaps that illustrate his astonishing demonstrations of the changing and relative nature of color. Also included for the first time are new studies from the Albers archive, produced by the artist&#x2019;s students in the early 1960s.&nbsp;A celebration of Albers&#x2019;s legendary achievements, this beautiful publication is an essential addition to any serious art library.</p><p><b>Josef Albers</b>, one of the most influential artist-educators of the 20th century, was a member of the Bauhaus group in Germany during the 1920s.

The author offers a clear exposition both of the historical development of each ideology and of the impact it has had on contemporary political behaviour, movements, parties and governments. In recent years, political commentators have heralded a renaissance of popular political ideology, characterised by a resurgence of issues and political traditions that many had thought obsolete. This new edition is updated throughout to take account of these developments, broadening its appeal internationally.</p> <p>The book is particularly relevant for first and second year undergraduate teaching, and can be used to structure a whole course on political ideologies covering traditional ideologies (conservatism, socialism, liberalism, anarchism and fascism) as well as concepts which have developed into concrete ideologies more recently (multiculturalism, feminism and ecologism, amongst others).&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Andrew Heywood is author of such best-selling textbooks as Politics, Political Ideologies and Global Politics, used by hundreds of thousands of students around the world. Andrew was vice principal of Croydon College, having previously been director of studies at Orpington College and head of politics at Farnborough Sixth-Form College.</p>"The great merit of Andrew Heywood's book is that he takes ideology seriously, and explores patiently and with admirable clarity the different characteristics of the classic western ideologies, as well as the new themes and directions of recent ideological thought. He has produced one of the best available introductions to the subject anywhere in print." --Andrew Gamble, Sheffield University<br></p><h2>Analyzing English Grammar</h2><p><p> <b>This advanced grammar text encourages students to think critically about grammar and exposes them to a variety of linguistic theories as it prepares them to become K-12 English teachers. </b> </p> <p> </p></p><p></p><h2>Music in Childhood Enhanced: From Preschool through the Elementary Grades, Spiral bound Version</h2><p>MUSIC IN CHILDHOOD: FROM PRESCHOOL THROUGH THE ELEMENTARY GRADES, equips you with the knowledge, tools and confidence to effectively teach music to children.

Set against the backdrop of upper-class New York society during the 1870s, the author&#39;s combination of powerful prose combined with a thoroughly researched and meticulous evocation of the manners and style of the period, has delighted readers since the novel&#39;s first publication in 1920. In 1921 The Age of Innocence achieved a double distinction - it won the Pulitzer Prize and it was the first time this prestigious award had been won by a woman author.</p><p>Somewhere in this book, Wharton observes that clever liars always come up with good stories to back up their fabrications, but that really clever liars don't bother to explain anything at all. This is the kind of insight that makes <i>The Age of Innocence </i> so indispensable. Wharton's story of the upper classes of Old New York, and Newland Archer's impossible love for the disgraced Countess Olenska, is a perfectly wrought book about an era when upper-class culture in this country was still a mixture of American and European extracts, and when "society" had rules as rigid as any in history.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

More people in Western Europe thought quantitatively in the sixteenth century than in any other part of the world, enabling them to become the world&#39;s leaders. With amusing detail and historical anecdote, Alfred Crosby discusses the shift from qualitative to quantitative perception that occurred during the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. Alfred W. Crosby is the author of five books, including the award-winning Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (Cambridge, 1986)</p><p><i>The Measure of Reality</i> is the third book in a series in which Alfred Crosby, a noted historian, asks how it is that Western European societies could have conquered so much of the world in the space of a few generations. The answer, he finds, is in certain agricultural and technological techniques. In this volume he turns to one set of techniques in particular: the precise measurement of time, number, and distance. That precise measurement enabled European armies to march in step, enabled navigators to find faraway ports, and enabled gunsmiths and chemists to formulate the weapons of conquest. These inventions were refined over centuries, but most came heavily into play in the years between 1250 and 1300, the period Crosby examines in closest detail. <i>The Measure of Reality</i> offers a fascinating, big-picture view of the artifacts that changed history.Western Europeans were among the first, if not the first, to invent mechanical clocks, geometrically precise maps, double-entry bookkeeping, precise algebraic and musical notations, and perspective painting.

Cross-cultural missteps regarding financial issues can derail partnerships between supporting churches and agencies and national leaders on the ground. North Americans don?t understand how cultural expectations of patronage shape how financial support is perceived and understood, and Western money often comes with subtle strings attached. So local mission work is hampered by perceived paternalism, and donors are frustrated with lack of results or accountability. How do we build financial partnerships for effective mission without fostering neo-colonialism? Cross-cultural specialist Mary Lederleitner brings missiological and financial expertise to explain how global mission efforts can be funded with integrity, mutuality and transparency. Bringing together social science research, biblical principles and on-the-ground examples, she presents best practices for handling funding and finance. Cross-cultural partnerships can foster dignity, build capacity and work toward long-term sustainability. Lederleitner also addresses particular problems like misallocation of funds, embezzlement and fraud. This book is an essential guide for all who partner in global mission, whether pastors of supporting churches or missionaries and funding agencies.</p><p><strong>Mary T. Lederleitner</strong> is a cross-cultural consultant with Wycliffe, where she conducts research, writes, creates training programs and provides consulting services to equip those involved in cross-cultural ministry partnerships. Her focus is on helping leaders contextualize and develop processes that will facilitate fruitful partnerships and better cross-cultural relationships. She has traveled extensively throughout the world providing coaching and business consulting to mission and indigenous ministry leaders. She has been published in <em>Evangelical Missions Quarterly</em> and is completing her Ph.D. at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School."Especially recommended for North American churches sending short-term mission teams overseas as well as for sponsors of partnering projects. Short term mission agencies. . .will welcome this anecdotal resource." (Roger E. Hedlund, Dharma Deepika, July-December 2010)<br><br>"A useful introduction to the subject, one that should be read by anyone engaged in cross-cultural partnerships or contemplating such a partnership. The mission community urgently needs more resources like this." (Steve Rundle, EMQ, July 2010)<br><br>"Lederleitner explains how global mission efforts can be funded with integrity, mutuality, and transparency. Offering the benefits of her experience in ministry partnerships and finances, Lederleitner presents best practices for handling funding." (CBA Retailers Resources, April 2010)<br><br>"Mary has done an incredible job in storying, through numerous case studies, the wedding as well as the marriage of good accountability and good cultural relationship. This book has showcased the deeply rooted but often glossed over relational challenge over money, men and materials that has bugged the kingdom from time immemorial. Here is a book that celebrates the vulnerability of both sides, examines the age-long mutual suspicion, and raises the bar to promote the dignity and integrity of both the giver and the receiver. I sense this book practically promotes nonthreatening, God-honoring accountability and sustainability of church family values in our quest to make Christ known across the globe. "I commend the grace and boldness given to her to put this together. It is a worthy work, because money matters a lot in mission. I enjoyed reading it, perhaps because there are so many true-life stories in virtually every chapter. I extol this work joyfully to the body of Christ worldwide as an unbiased, well-set-out and constructively presented view on money and global Christianity. I will particularly love to have numerous copies to give to missions leaders in Africa while recommending it for use in field preparatory trainings." (Timothy O. Olonade, executive secretary, Nigeria Evangelical Missions Association (NEMA))<br><br>"In matters of money, American evangelical mission has certainly made a mark in many positive ways, but our methodology in applying the funds has not always made such a positive mark. In this volume, Mary Lederleitner pulls some of those skeletons out of our dusty closets for a fresh examination of what we did right and what we could have done better. She offers many practical ways to avoid pitfalls as we move toward a more globalized mission partnership in the twenty-first century." (Gilles Gravelle, director of research and field project development, The Seed Company)<br><br>"<em>Cross-Cultural Partnerships</em> brings the rare combination of mind, heart and experience of a seasoned yet compassionate accountability expert who is also a missionary with extensive field experience. Its realistic portrayal of the issues and practical suggestions for policy and action make this an invaluable read for anyone wanting to address one of the critical, central issues in partnerships within the growing global church." (Phill Butler, director, Vision Synergy, and author of Well Connected: Releasing Power, Restoring Hope Through Kingdom Partnerships)<br><br>"Mary takes us straight to the intersection of mission, money, culture and partnerships. She walks us through key issues regarding money that can complicate, derail and even destroy cross-cultural partnerships. Using biblical perspectives, categories from anthropology and practical experience, she provides valuable guidance. This is a must-read for anyone struggling with the role of money in such contexts." (John Watters, former executive director of Wycliffe Bible Translators International)<br><br>"In our globalized world the North American missions community needs <em>Cross-Cultural Partnerships!</em> I found it filled with practical, down-to-earth advice built on extensive experience and solid research. Mary is much more than just an accountant with a decade of living experience working through issues of partnering with others; she truly knows how to compassionately listen, apply what she learns to test it out and then pass it on to the rest of us in ways that will benefit the whole body of Christ." (Scott Moreau, professor of missions and intercultural studies, Wheaton College Graduate School, and author of Introducing World Missions)<br><br>"Mary Lederleitner's conversational style combined with her fair-minded approach creates a book that is friendly as well as informative about a tough subject. She wastes no time pointing out the gorilla in the room when it comes to money in cross-cultural partnerships--cultural differences. Important as it is, culture is no excuse for bad behavior, and she tackles that as well with helpful material on how to prevent and detect embezzlement and fraud. If you read only one of the few books on money in mission partnerships, read this one." (Daniel Rickett, author of Making Your Partnership Work and Building Strategic Relationships)<br><br>"Money is the defining and dividing issue in cross-cultural partnerships, and Mary Lederleitner has given us the essential cultural insights and very practical tools and applications to navigate these treacherous waters. Writing from years of experience, Mary shines light on our harmful assumptions and then guides us to better and biblical ways to achieve accountability, build capacity and create sustainable partnerships with lasting impact for the kingdom of God. This very compact book is a must for everyone who aspires to partner with Majority World leaders and churches. Its fresh insights and applications make it invaluable as a training tool, one that I will use in seminars for Western and Majority World church and mission leaders."

This collection of 195 charted designs, originally collected prior to World War I by Emil Sigerus, is an invaluable source of unusual and interesting ideas of modern cross-stitchers and other craftspeople.<br>These ornate, highly stylized designs cover a vast array of moods and historical epochs, from the medieval (mounted knights, falconers, winged horses, dragons, gryphons) to the strikingly modern (abstract designs, unusual geometric forms, florals) and range in complexity from simple patterns composed of a few lines to very intricate symmetrical designs. Portions of these designs are also a source of many repeat and border patterns and spot decorations.<br>The designs are printed on a chart so that they can easily be used for needlepoint, Fair Isle knitting, rug-hooking, or any other form of counted-thread embroidery. And because the chart makes it easy to vary the size of each design, you can use the patterns to decorate anything from small pillows to bedspreads or wallhangings. Other craftspeople can transfer the patterns onto wood, metal, canvas, or mosaic to achieve stimulating and unusual effects.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>The Book of Shaker Furniture</h2><p>Of the more than one hundred experiments in communitarian living that proliferated in America during the nineteenth century, the Untied Society of Believers in Christ&#39;s Second Appearing , whose adherents are best known as &#34;Shakers,&#34; is certainly one of the most interesting, successful, and enduring.

At its center is Samuel Andresen-Anderson, a failed writer and increasingly apathetic college professor, who gets a second chance at literary fame from the most unlikely source&#x2014;the mother who abandoned him as a child. The American public is up in arms about a rather absurd crime that Samuel&#x2019;s mother committed against an obnoxious politician. While Sam is shocked and surprised to learn the whereabouts of his estranged mother, he also realizes it&#x2019;s the chance of a lifetime to tap into the zeitgeist with some choice tidbits about her, if he can write it before media A.D.D. sets in. But in order to write the book that will revive him, Samuel is forced to dig into her life, and he discovers a completely different version of the woman he thought he knew; it turns out he&#x2019;s not the only one who&#x2019;s life is carved out of traumatic events. Nathan Hill is incredibly perceptive, as in this, which I can&#x2019;t stop thinking about: &#x201c;The things we love the most are the most disfiguring.

There is always the danger that a single person becomes so used to the bachelor or spinster routine that a sudden change in circumstances proves difficult to accommodate. Or so the folk wisdom goes. There is a similar piece of folk wisdom that claims that parents, on launching the last of their children, feel the loss acutely, rapidly declining into the empty-nest syndrome. Both these beliefs are largely false. Married couples &#x2013; or those choosing to live together as bidies-in (and there is no more appropriate term to express that notion than this couthy Scots expression) &#x2013; both adjust remarkably quickly to the sharing of bed and board. Indeed, after a few days, in many cases, a previous life is more or less entirely forgotten, and each person believes that he and she, or he and he, or she and she, have lived together for a very long time. In this way Daphnis and Chlo�, or Romeo and Juliet, can only too quickly become Darby and Joan, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, or any other famous domestic couple.<br> &nbsp;<br> As for the received view about the so-called empty-nest syndrome, like many syndromes, it barely exists. In most cases, parents do feel a slight pang on the leaving of home by their children, but this pang tends to occur before the offspring go, and it is largely a dread of the syndrome itself rather than concern over the actual departure. In this way it is similar to many of the moral panics that afflict an imaginative society from time to time: the fear of what might happen in the future is almost always worse than the future that eventually arrives. So when the child finally goes off to university, or takes a gap year, or moves out to live with coevals, the parents might find themselves feeling strange for a day or two, but often find themselves exhilarated by their new freedom. Very soon it feels entirely normal to have the house to yourself, such is the rapidity with which most people can adjust to new circumstances. And of course if the child has been reluctant to leave home and has remained there until his late twenties, or even beyond, how much more grateful is the parent for this change. Empty-nest syndrome, then, might be redefined altogether, to refer to the feeling of anticipation and longing which affects those whose nest is not emptying quickly enough.<br> &nbsp;<br> For Matthew and his wife, Elspeth Harmony, the adjustment to married life was both rapid and thoroughly pleasant. Neither had the slightest doubt that the right choice had been made &#x2013; not only in respect of deciding to get married at all, but also in their choice of partner. Matthew loved Elspeth Harmony &#x2013; he loved her to the extent that everything that was associated with her, her possessions, her sayings, her friends and connections, were all endowed with a quality of specialness that attached to nothing else. The mug from which she drank her morning coffee was special because her lips had touched it; the tortoiseshell comb that she kept on top of the dressing table was special because it had belonged to Elspeth&#x2019;s grandmother rather than to any other grandmother; the shopping list that she wrote out to take with her to Valvona &amp; Crolla was special because it was in her handwriting. His affection for her was total, and touching.<br> &nbsp;<br> For her part, Elspeth could not believe the sheer good fortune that had brought them together. She had always wanted to get married, from her university days onwards, but as the years passed&#x202f;&#x2013; and she was only twenty-eight at the time of Matthew&#x2019;s proposal&#x202f;&#x2013; she had become increasingly concerned that nobody would ask her. There had been one or two boyfriends, but they had not been serious, and her intuitive understanding of this had meant that the relationships had been brief. She saw no point, really, in persisting with a man who would not be with her in a year or two&#x2019;s time. Why invest emotional energy in something that was not expected to last? In her view that led to disappointment and loss, and this could be avoided by simply not taking up with the man in the first place.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then Matthew came into her life, and everything changed. It was at such a difficult time, too, very close to that traumatic incident when she had succumbed to her irritation over Olive&#x2019;s mistreatment of Bertie &#x2013; Olive had used her junior nurse&#x2019;s kit to diagnose Bertie as suffering from leprosy &#x2013; and had pinched Olive&#x2019;s ear quite hard, something she had wanted to do for some time but which she had refrained from doing because to do so would be contrary to every principle of education and child care she had been taught. The fact that Olive richly deserved this pinch, and indeed might benefit from such a sharp reminder of moral cause and effect, was not a mitigating factor, and she had been obliged to resign from her position at the school. Matthew had been there to save her from the consequences of all this. While other boyfriends might have expressed regret over what she had done, and questioned its wisdom, Matthew sided with her completely and unequivocally, making it clear that he believed that the act of pinching Olive&#x2019;s ear was a blow for pedagogic sanity.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There are many children who would be improved by such a pinch,&#x201d; he observed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Elspeth thought about this. In normal circumstances she would follow the party line and say that one should never raise a hand to a child or indeed pinch any of its extremities, but mulling over Matthew&#x2019;s pronouncement she came to the conclusion that she could think of quite a number of children who would benefit from a short, sharp pinch. Tofu, in particular, might be improved by a small amount of judiciously administered physical violence, even if only to stop him spitting at the other children. Perhaps if teachers spat at him he would get the message, but modern educational theory definitely frowned on teachers who spat at their pupils. That was the world in which we lived.<br> &nbsp;<br> And now all that was behind her. Matthew had rescued her from professional ignominy and given her a new purpose in life. He had showered her with love, and she felt nothing but tenderness for this kind and gentle man, who had given her his name, his home, his fortune, and himself.</p><h2>Culture and Society: 1780-1950</h2><p>Acknowledged as perhaps <i>the</i> masterpiece of materialist criticism in the English language, this omnibus ranges over British literary history from George Eliot to George Orwell to inquire about the complex ways economic reality shapes the imagination.</p><p>The organizing principle of this book is the discovery that the idea of culture, and the word itself in its general modern uses, came into English thinking in the period which we commonly describe as that of the Industrial Revolution.

It gives authoritative readings of the major long poems and sequences of Stevens and deals at length with the important shorter works as well, showing their complex relations both to one another and to the work of Stevens's precursors, Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, Emerson, and Whitman. No other book on Stevens is as ambitious or comprehensive as this one: everyone who writes on Stevens will have to take it into account. The product of twenty years of meditating, thinking, and writing about Stevens, this truly remarkable book is a brilliant extension of Bloom's theories of literary interpretation.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Shingle Style and the Stick Style: Architectural Theory and Design from Downing to the Origins of Wright; Revised Edition (Yale Publications in the History of Art)</h2><p>As the definitive study of the complex inspirations and cultural influences that were fused in the Shingle Style of wooden suburban and resort buildings of the period 1872 to 1889, Mr. Scully&#x2019;s book has received much critical acclaim.&nbsp; He presents the published designs and the written statements of the architects, as well as contemporary criticisms of the buildings to analyze the development of the Shingle Style from Richardson&#x2019;s early work to Wright&#x2019;s first house in Oak Park.&nbsp; An analysis of the Colonial Revival is central to the work, which is now enhanced by the addition of an extensive related chapter on the &#x201c;Stick Style&#x201d; of the mid-century.&nbsp; A new preface has been added and the bibliography and footnotes are brought up to date.&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;The last section of the book, on the origins and early development of Frank Lloyd Wright, is one of Scully&#x2019;s best.&nbsp; This chapter...shows a mature understanding and a just handling of the academic tradition and of the early work of one of America&#x2019;s greatest architects.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>The Art Bulletin</i><br>&#x201c;Scully&#x2019;s research is exhaustive, his scholarship impeccable.&nbsp; His illustrations alone form a gold mine of information on the period.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians</i></p><p>As the definitive study of the complex inspirations and cultural influences that were fused in the Shingle Style of wooden suburban and resort buildings of the period 1872 to 1889, Mr. Scully&#39;s book has received much critical acclaim.</p><h2>Southeastern Indians</h2><p>A broad introduction to the prehistory, social institutions, and history of the native people of the southeastern United States</p><p>Charles Hudson (1932-2013) was the Franklin Professor of Anthropology and History at the University of Georgia before retiring in 2000.

Tapscott's selections cover the full range, from the Modernist generation though the Mexican Revolutionary post-Moderns and the Vanguardist poets to very contemporary younger writers of political and experimental commitments.

In it author Unica Z�rn traces the roots of her obsessions: The exotic father she idealized, the "impure" mother she detested, the masochistic fantasies and onanistic rituals which she said described "the erotic life of a little girl based on my own childhood." <i>Dark Spring</i> is the story of a young girl's simultaneous introduction to sexuality and mental illness, revealing a different aspect of the "mad love" so romanticized by the (predominantly male) Surrealists. <b>Unica Z�rn</b> (1916-1970) emigrated in 1953 from her native Berlin to Paris in order to live with the artist Hans Bellmer. There she exhibited drawings as a member of the Surrealist group and collaborated with Bellmer on a series of notorious photographs of her nude torso bound with string. In 1957, a fateful encounter with the poet and painter Henri Michaux led to the first of what would become a series of mental crises, some of which she documented in her writings. She committed suicide in 1970--an act foretold in this, her last completed work.</p><p>Preadolescent sexuality merges with depressive fantasy--to devastating (if ineffably morbid) effect in this once-notorious novel by a German writer and artist (1916&#x2013;70) who, like this novel's young protagonist, took her own life shortly after its (1967) publication. She's a nameless suburban girl who's provoked, by her slovenly mother's indifference, her beloved father's long absences from home, and her own claustrophobic self-absorption, into masturbatory daydreams and tentative baby steps toward adult sexual expression. The story's (expertly caught) tone and rhythm are indeed hypnotic (though one nowhere senses the complexity attributed to it by translator Rupprecht's labored introduction), and Z�rn caps it with a marvelously bleak, brisk final scene. Unusual and memorable fiction. -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

He lives in&nbsp;Portland, Oregon.Chapter 1<br><br>It was a warm summer afternoon,&nbsp;and the Warren Hotel&nbsp;trundled over the countryside&nbsp;upon its enormous metal<br> legs. The steady CLANG! CLANG!&nbsp;CLANG! of its footfalls were loud&nbsp;enough to be heard for miles, but Warren&nbsp;the 13th hardly noticed; the deafening&nbsp;din had become as comforting and&nbsp;familiar to him as the gentle ticking&nbsp;of a grandfather clock.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren knelt on the hotel roof,&nbsp;repairing a broken tile with a hammer&nbsp;and nails. The six crows who lived in the&nbsp;rooftop birdhouse poked their heads out of&nbsp;its windows, croaking for food. Warren set&nbsp;down his hammer and removed a sketchbook&nbsp;from his pocket; he always kept a few&nbsp;slices of cheese tucked between its pages.&nbsp;He tossed them to the birds, who promptly&nbsp;began squabbling over the pieces.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Share, share!&#x201d; Warren admonished.&nbsp;&#x201c;There&#x2019;s enough for everyone.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The crows were lazy and wouldn&#x2019;t leave&nbsp;the birdhouse to search for their own food,&nbsp;but Warren didn&#x2019;t mind. He enjoyed caring&nbsp;for each and every guest of his hotel, even&nbsp;the ones with feathers.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the birds ate, Warren leaned back&nbsp;against the chimney and flipped through&nbsp;his sketchbook. Its pages were filled with&nbsp;charcoal drawings: doodles of his friends&nbsp;and family at the hotel, and portraits of the&nbsp;fantastic landscapes he&#x2019;d seen on his travels.&nbsp;But Warren had no time for sketching&nbsp;today; there were too many other problems&nbsp;demanding his attention. He turned to a&nbsp;fresh page and began jotting down a lengthy&nbsp;to-do list, based on all the calls to the front&nbsp;desk he&#x2019;d received that morning:<br><br>Room 304<br>Small leak in bathroom ceiling.<br>Room 404<br>Large leak in bathroom ceiling.<br>Room 504<br>Giant leak in bathroom ceiling.<br>Room 604<br>Overflowing toilet; water won't turn off.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren was very busy, yet he had no&nbsp;complaints. In fact, he felt like the luckiest&nbsp;boy on earth. He ran the world&#x2019;s first&#x2014;and&nbsp;only&#x2014;traveling hotel, and it was so popular&nbsp;that every room was filled! On top of that,&nbsp;the hotel was generating so much money&nbsp;that Warren was finally able to make some&nbsp;much-needed improvements to the antiquated&nbsp;structure. He&#x2019;d installed a viewing&nbsp;room lined with panoramic windows for the&nbsp;guests to enjoy the scenery as the hotel went&nbsp;along its way. He also added a large window&nbsp;to the control room, so he no longer had&nbsp;to rely on a tiny periscope to navigate the&nbsp;terrain.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps the biggest advancement was&nbsp;a hidden feature that Warren had discovered&nbsp;inside the control room. It turned&nbsp;out that one of his ancestors, Warren the&nbsp;2nd, had had a few tricks up his sleeve when&nbsp;he designed the walking hotel, including&nbsp;a special autopilot feature. This option&nbsp;ensured that the hotel would dutifully&nbsp;continue along the road following the&nbsp;precise coordinates input by Warren each&nbsp;morning. Placing the hotel on autopilot&nbsp;spared Warren from having to drive the&nbsp;hotel all day long. Instead, he had the&nbsp;freedom to roam about, mingle with guests,&nbsp;and head up to the roof to repair broken&nbsp;tiles and make to-do lists.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly, Warren&#x2019;s concentration&nbsp;was broken by the sound of a sputtering&nbsp;engine and a <i>HONK! HONK! HONK!</i>&nbsp;He dropped down on his hands and knees&nbsp;and scrambled to the edge of the roof. Far&nbsp;below, an odd-looking automobile was&nbsp;weaving dangerously between the hotel&#x2019;s&nbsp;enormous legs. It had oversized wheels and&nbsp;was painted in garish colors. Its carriage&nbsp;was cluttered with crates, bags, and jugs.&nbsp;On the side were fancy, curlicue letters&nbsp;proclaiming:<br><br>SLY'S MIRACLE&nbsp;ELIXIRS,&nbsp;TINCTURES, AND CORDIALS<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The car continued to honk as it&nbsp;screeched around the hotel&#x2019;s crashing&nbsp;footfalls. &#x201c;Be careful!&#x201d; Warren yelled,&nbsp;even as he realized that yelling was pointless;&nbsp;the car had already passed the hotel&nbsp;and was now branching off the main road,&nbsp;following a dustier and narrower path that&nbsp;offered a direct route to the Malwoods.&nbsp;Warren watched until he couldn&#x2019;t see the&nbsp;car anymore, wondering why anyone would&nbsp;drive toward such a spooky place.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over the past few months, Warren had&nbsp;piloted the hotel to many unusual destinations,&nbsp;but one place he swore he&#x2019;d never go&nbsp;was the Malwoods&#x2014;a shadowy and twisted&nbsp;forest teeming with witches and other, even&nbsp;more dangerous creatures. Because Warren&nbsp;took the safety of his guests very seriously,&nbsp;he hesitated to travel within five miles of&nbsp;the Malwoods. He opened his sketchbook&nbsp;and added yet another item to his to-do list:&nbsp;Rewire autopilot to avoid this intersection&nbsp;altogether.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had barely finished writing when&nbsp;the air beside him shimmered. A swirling&nbsp;portal materialized, and out stepped his&nbsp;best friend, Petula. She wore a grave expression.&nbsp;Behind her the pool of silvery-looking&nbsp;liquid vanished.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;The guest in Room 204 just called to&nbsp;complain,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Something about a&nbsp;leaky ceiling.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren sighed. &#x201c;Sometimes I wish there&nbsp;were two of me,&#x201d; he admitted.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He tucked away his sketchbook and&nbsp;Petula helped him to his feet. The first time&nbsp;Warren had met Petula, he&#x2019;d mistaken her&nbsp;for a ghost. She always dressed entirely in&nbsp;white, and her skin was so pale that it looked&nbsp;nearly translucent. He&#x2019;d since learned that&nbsp;this was just one of her many unusual traits,&nbsp;along with her ability to draw magical pathways&nbsp;between short distances. She was a&nbsp;young perfumier-in-training, and she was&nbsp;learning the fine art of witch capturing&nbsp;from her mother, Beatrice.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Petula glanced down at Warren&#x2019;s to-do&nbsp;list. &#x201c;Maybe you should hire a maintenance&nbsp;person,&#x201d; she suggested. &#x201c;So you don&#x2019;t have&nbsp;to do everything yourself.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren shook his head. &#x201c;My dad always&nbsp;said that a good manager doesn&#x2019;t sit behind&nbsp;a desk and bark orders. A good manager&nbsp;pitches in and helps with the dirty work.&#x201d;&nbsp;He grimaced. &#x201c;Even if it means unclogging&nbsp;a toilet.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You might be taking your father&#x2019;s&nbsp;advice a bit too literally,&#x201d; Petula said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Warren said, &#x201c;but someone&nbsp;has to do the work.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tucking his sketchbook in his pocket,&nbsp;Warren started to stand up but lost his&nbsp;balance, landing with a hard thump.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Ow!&#x201d; Warren cried. He felt as if the&nbsp;roof had slipped out from under him.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Petula looked alarmed. &#x201c;What was that?&#x201d;&nbsp;But before Warren could answer, the hotel&nbsp;lurched again, harder, and this time Warren&nbsp;fell face-first. He realized he was rushing&nbsp;forward&#x2014;in fact, the entire hotel was&nbsp;rushing forward. Warren scrabbled against&nbsp;the slick tiles, trying to grab something&#x2014;&nbsp;anything&#x2014;but his fingers were too short&nbsp;to get a good grip. He found himself sliding&nbsp;on his belly, headed for the edge of the roof.&nbsp;And so was Petula!<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Warren!&#x201d; she cried.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren&#x2019;s stomach flipped as he picked&nbsp;up speed. The edge of the roof zoomed&nbsp;toward him&#x2014;but there, at the end of the&nbsp;tiles, was a skinny tin gutter. If he timed it&nbsp;just right . . .<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Squeezing his eyes shut, Warren flung&nbsp;out an arm. His fingers met metal. He&nbsp;grabbed hard. And he held on tight.&nbsp;Warren opened his eyes just in time to&nbsp;see Petula tumbling past him. Her hand&nbsp;missed the gutter by inches, but at the&nbsp;very last moment she managed to grasp&nbsp;Warren&#x2019;s ankle.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Hold on!&#x201d; he yelled. He saw Petula&nbsp;dangling from his foot by one hand, the&nbsp;ground rushing up behind her. &#x201c;Because&nbsp;here comes the&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And with that, the building smashed&nbsp;into the earth with a loud crash.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Somehow, the hotel had fallen.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d; called Petula.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2014;I think so,&#x201d; Warren called back.&nbsp;Clouds of dust rose around them and the&nbsp;air was eerily still. Warren&#x2019;s arms started to&nbsp;shake from the effort of holding on to the&nbsp;gutter.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The weight on his ankle disappeared and&nbsp;a portal materialized on the side&#x2014;well,&nbsp;now the top&#x2014;of the hotel. Out jumped&nbsp;Petula. She grabbed Warren by both wrists&nbsp;and yanked him upright next to her.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I think the hotel tripped,&#x201d; Petula said.&nbsp;She looked even paler than usual.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Tripped?&#x201d; Warren said. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s&nbsp;impossible!&#x201d; In the past six months, the&nbsp;hotel had marched up hillsides, forded&nbsp;streams, and crossed chasms, all without a&nbsp;single misstep. &#x201c;There are seven different&nbsp;safety features to keep the hotel from falling&nbsp;over!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Well, all seven of them must have&nbsp;failed,&#x201d; said Petula, &#x201c;because the hotel fell&nbsp;right on its face. See?&#x201d; She pointed at their&nbsp;feet.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sure enough, instead of the roof,&nbsp;Warren&#x2019;s shoes were resting on a pane of&nbsp;glass&#x2014;a window! On the other side, two&nbsp;angry guests lay crumpled on the floor&#x2014;well, actually the wall, which was now the&nbsp;floor&#x2014;shaking angry fists in his direction.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We'd better get to the control room,&#x201d;&nbsp;Warren said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Do you want me to draw a portal?&#x201d;&nbsp;Petula asked.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No, thanks.&#x201d; Ordinarily, a portal&nbsp;would be welcome, since the control room&nbsp;was all the way down in the basement. But&nbsp;after falling and rolling off the side of the&nbsp;building, Warren was way too dizzy for the&nbsp;head-spinning side effects of magical travel.&nbsp;&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s take the long way.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, the long way was now extra&nbsp;long, thanks to the topsy-turvy state of the&nbsp;hotel. Carefully, Warren picked his way over&nbsp;to the window of his attic bedroom, sliding&nbsp;it open and dropping through the gap as if&nbsp;it was a trap door. He landed with both feet&nbsp;on a wall he&#x2019;d decorated with sketches and&nbsp;drawings. When he realized he was standing&nbsp;on one of his favorite illustrations, he quickly&nbsp;hopped off.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Petula climbed down after him, then&nbsp;looked around in astonishment. &#x201c;Weird!&#x201d;&nbsp;It was weird. Normally, Warren accessed&nbsp;his bedroom through a trap door in the floor,&nbsp;but now the trap door was in the middle of a&nbsp;wall. Warren pulled it open like a porthole,&nbsp;pushed himself up, and wriggled his way&nbsp;headfirst to the other side. The long hallway&nbsp;was familiar but mixed-up, with doors&nbsp;in the ceiling, doors in the floor, and miniature&nbsp;chandeliers dangling from either side&nbsp;of the trap door like a pair of earrings.&nbsp;Warren felt dizzy and confused just looking&nbsp;at them.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Clearly he wasn&#x2019;t the only one. Behind&nbsp;the floor-doors and the ceiling-doors,&nbsp;Warren could hear the muffled voices of&nbsp;guests. And they were not happy.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; one angry man&nbsp;shouted.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Just a tiny mishap,&#x201d; Warren answered&nbsp;back.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;How do we get out of here?&#x201d; cried a&nbsp;woman&#x2019;s voice.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Stay in your room, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; Petula&nbsp;advised. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be up and running in just a&nbsp;few minutes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren gulped. He certainly hoped that&nbsp;was true.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Above them, between the ceiling-doors,&nbsp;was the gap that led to the grand staircase,&nbsp;which descended through each of the eight&nbsp;levels of the hotel. Normally, Warren could&nbsp;ride the bannister all the way down to the&nbsp;lobby, but gravity was no longer on his side.&nbsp;They&#x2019;d have to find another way.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We can take the elevator,&#x201d; Petula said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;But it hasn&#x2019;t worked in years,&#x201d; Warren&nbsp;said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Exactly!&#x201d; Petula replied.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren realized what Petula meant.&nbsp;With the hotel now lying on its side, the&nbsp;elevator shaft was the most direct route&nbsp;from the top floor to the lobby. He took off&nbsp;for the end of the hallway, carefully jumping&nbsp;over the doors and wall sconces under his<br>feet.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The doors were closed, as always, and a&nbsp;sign on the front said:<br><br>OUT OF SERVICE<br>Our apologies for the inconvenience.<br>&#x2014;MGMT.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren had written the words himself,&nbsp;using his best handwriting. He&#x2019;d been especially&nbsp;proud to sign it &#x201c;Mgmt.,&#x201d; knowing&nbsp;that he was the one doing the managing&nbsp;these days. But now the sign had to come<br> off. He removed it carefully, then rolled up&nbsp;his sleeves. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to have to pry it&nbsp;open.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Petula nodded, and together she and&nbsp;Warren wiggled their fingers into the seam&nbsp;between the doors. With a great groaning&nbsp;creak, the two heavy panels grated apart,&nbsp;one rolling up and the other disappearing&nbsp;down. Inside, the elevator shaft was very&nbsp;dark.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You first,&#x201d; Warren said, hoping he&nbsp;sounded polite rather than scared.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Petula went ahead, ducking quickly out&nbsp;of sight.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Wow!&#x201d; came her voice. Warren scrambled&nbsp;after her. The elevator shaft was chilly&nbsp;and smelled like axle grease. They picked&nbsp;their way down&#x2014;or, Warren supposed,&nbsp;across&#x2014;toward the lobby. Pipes, pulleys,&nbsp;chains, and gears crowded their footsteps,&nbsp;and the only light came from thin strips&nbsp;that shone through the doors at every&nbsp;floor they passed. After counting down&nbsp;from eight, they reached the final set of&nbsp;doors. With a mighty push&#x2014;and help from&nbsp;Petula&#x2014;Warren wrenched the doors open&nbsp;and tumbled forward into the lobby.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Oh dear,&#x201d; Petula said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rubbing his head, Warren rose to his&nbsp;feet. Oh dear was right. The lobby&#x2014;the&nbsp;grand entrance to the Warren Hotel, the&nbsp;first thing that guests saw upon arriving&nbsp;and the last thing they saw before they&nbsp;left&#x2014;was in utter chaos. The stately potted&nbsp;plants had tipped over, spilling dirt everywhere.&nbsp;The curtains had slid off their rods&nbsp;and lay lumped in the corner of the room&nbsp;like sad velvety ghosts. The lobby desk had&nbsp;overturned, its papers scattered across the&nbsp;ground. The grand chandelier hung limply&nbsp;from the side of the room, opposite the&nbsp;checkered tile floor that was now acting as&nbsp;the wall.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;This is going to require a lot of cleanup,&#x201d;&nbsp;Petula observed.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warren almost sighed but stopped&nbsp;short. No true manager would ever act so...</p><h2>I Like to Watch: Arguing My Way Through the TV Revolution</h2><p><b>From <i>The New Yorker</i>&#x2019;s fiercely original, Pulitzer Prize-winning culture critic, a provocative collection of new&nbsp;and previously published essays arguing that we are what we watch.</b><br><b><br>&#x201c;Emily Nussbaum is the perfect critic&#x2014;smart, engaging, funny, generous, and insightful.&#x201d;&#x2014;David Grann, author of&nbsp;<i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i></b><br><br> From her creation of the &#x201c;Approval Matrix&#x201d; in <i>New York </i>magazine in 2004 to her Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning columns for <i>The New Yorker,</i> Emily Nussbaum has argued for a new way of looking at TV. In this collection, including two never-before-published essays, Nussbaum writes about her passion for television, beginning with <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer,</i> the show that set her on a fresh intellectual path. She explores the rise of the female screw-up, how fans warp the shows they love, the messy power of sexual violence on TV, and the year that jokes helped elect a reality-television president. There are three big profiles of television showrunners&#x2014;Kenya Barris, Jenji Kohan, and Ryan Murphy&#x2014;as well as examinations of the legacies of Norman Lear and Joan Rivers. The book also includes a major new essay written during the year of #MeToo, wrestling with the question of what to do when the artist you love is a monster.<br><br>More than a collection of reviews, the book makes a case for toppling the status anxiety that has long haunted the &#x201c;idiot box,&#x201d; even as it transformed. Through it all, Nussbaum recounts her fervent search, over fifteen years, for a new kind of criticism, one that resists the false hierarchy that elevates one kind of culture (violent, dramatic, gritty) over another (joyful, funny, stylized). <i>I Like to Watch</i> traces her own struggle to punch through stifling notions of &#x201c;prestige television,&#x201d; searching for a more expansive, more embracing vision of artistic ambition&#x2014;one that acknowledges many types of beauty and complexity and opens to more varied voices. It&#x2019;s a book that celebrates television <i>as</i> television, even as each year warps the definition of just what that might mean.<br><br><b>Advance praise for </b><i><b>I Like to Watch</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;This collection, including some powerful new work, proves once and for all that there&#x2019;s no better American critic of anything than Emily Nussbaum. But&nbsp;<i>I Like to Watch</i>&nbsp;turns out to be even greater than the sum of its brilliant parts&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the most&nbsp;incisive, intimate, entertaining, authoritative guide to the shows of this golden television age.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Kurt Andersen, author of&nbsp;<i>Fantasyland</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Reading Emily Nussbaum makes us smarter not just about what we watch, but about how we live, what we love, and who we are.&nbsp;<i>I Like to Watch&nbsp;</i>is a joy.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Rebecca Traister</b></p><p><b>Emily Nussbaum</b> has written for <i>The New Yorker</i> since 2011.

And then the rules change, midway through? That&#x2019;s the crisis that I&#x2019;m currently facing, when it comes to the beauty and power&#x2014;and lately, even the definition&#x2014;of television as an art form.<br><br> When I first began watching television, there didn&#x2019;t seem to be much to argue about. Like many children of the seventies, I grew up sitting cross-legged in front of a big console in the living room, singing along to <i>The Electric Company </i>while my mom made Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese. I dug <i>Taxi, </i>I loved <i>M*A*S*H</i>. In my teens, I memorized <i>Monty Python </i>sketches with my friend Maria. But I also regarded TV the way that Americans had been taught to, since the 1950s. Television was junk. It wasn&#x2019;t worthy of deep thought, the way that books or movies might be. It was something that you enjoyed, then forgot about. It wasn&#x2019;t until my thirties that I had what amounted to a soul-shaking conversion, on the night that I watched Sunnydale High School principal Bob Flutie die, torn to bits by hyenas.&nbsp;<br><br> At the time, in the spring of 1997, I was a literature doctoral student at NYU, foggily planning on becoming a professor, maybe a Victorianist, but anyway, somebody who read for a living. Every morning, I woke up, flopped onto the sofa, and opened up yet another 900-pager. Across the room was an old-fashioned console TV, a dinosaur even for the era, with a broken remote control, so in order to watch my first episode of <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer, </i>I had to physically walk across the room, then click the circular dial over to Channel 11, The WB, a brand-new &#x201c;netlet,&#x201d; and then walk all the way back to the sofa.&nbsp;<br><br> Walking across the room to change the channel was still a normal thing to do, in 1997. It had been nearly sixty years since the first television (spookily nicknamed the Phantom Teleceiver) launched at the 1939 World&#x2019;s Fair, and yet the medium was&#x2014;with a few advances, like the addition of color and the still-tentative expansion of cable&#x2014;not that different from what it had been in the 1950s, when families gathered to watch Milton Berle. Shows aired once a week. They were broken up by ads. When the ads were on, you peed. When they ended, someone in the other room would yell, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re missing it!&#x201d; and you&#x2019;d run back in. If you loved a particular show, you had to consult the elaborate grids in the print newspaper or in <i>TV Guide </i>to know when to watch: &#x201c;<i>ALF </i>(CC)&#x2014;Comedy. ALF is upstaged by a loveable dog that followed Brian home, so he gives the pooch away to a crotchety woman (Anne Ramsey).&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> The main thing, though, was that television went away. It was a disposable product, like a Dixie Cup. Although scripted television hadn&#x2019;t aired live for many decades, it still <i>felt </i>live. You could watch rental movies on your VCR (and for a few years, they were everywhere) but most people I was friendly with didn&#x2019;t regularly pre-program theirs to record much TV, because doing so was such a pain: spinning three plastic dials, for the day, the hour, and the minute. Each videotape held only a few hours of programming; rewinding and fast-forwarding were clumsy processes (and pausing might break the tape). There were no DVDs yet, let alone&nbsp;DVRs. Even if you were an early Internet adopter, which I was, dialing in was a grindingly slow, unreliable process&#x2014;and when you <i>did </i>connect, with the hostile shriek of static that we optimistically called a &#x201c;handshake,&#x201d; no videos showed up, just a wall of blinking neon fonts. Nothing, ever, arrived &#x201c;on demand.&#x201d;<br><br>This glitchy, ephemeral quality, and the ads that broke up the episodes, were a major part of TV&#x2019;s crappy reputation. This part may be hard to remember, even if you lived through it. But just before the turn of the century&#x2014;nearly universally, by default, and with an intensity that&#x2019;s tough to summon up now&#x2014;television was viewed as a shameful activity, as &#x201c;chewing gum for the eyes,&#x201d; to quote drama critic John Mason Brown. This was true not only of snobs who boasted that they &#x201c;didn&#x2019;t even own a TV&#x201d;; it was true of people who <i>liked </i>TV. It was true of the people who made it, too. TV was entertainment, not art. It was furniture (literally&#x2014;it sat in your living room) that helped you kill time (it was how to numb lonely hours while eating a &#x201c;TV dinner,&#x201d; shorthand for a pathetic existence). TV might be a gold mine, economically speaking, but that only made it more corrupt. If you were an artist, writing TV was selling out; if you were an intellectual, watching it was a sordid pleasure, like chain-smoking. People still referred to television, with no irony, as &#x201c;the boob tube&#x201d; and &#x201c;the idiot box.&#x201d; (Some people still do.)<br><br>This is not to say there were no good shows. Critics praised (and, often, overpraised) the grit of <i>Hill Street Blues, </i>the nihilistic wit of <i>Seinfeld, </i>yadda yadda yadda. In the mid-&#x2019;90s, there were several major breakthroughs in the medium, among them the teen drama <i>My So-Called Life </i>and the sci-fi series <i>The X-Files</i>. But among serious people, even the best television wasn&#x2019;t considered worthy of real analysis. This was particularly true among my grad-school peers, the thinky guys whom I had privately nicknamed &#x201c;the sweater-vests&#x201d;&#x2014;the men who were also, not coincidentally, the ones whose opinions tended to dominate mainstream media conversation. For them, books were sacrosanct. Movies were respected. Television was a sketchy additive that corporations had&nbsp;tipped into the cultural tap water, a sort of spiritual backbone-weakener.<br><br>The scripture for this set of thinkers was an essay by the writer George W. S. Trow, &#x201c;Within the Context of No-Context,&#x201d; which people recommended to me so frequently that it started to feel like a prank. A masterwork of contempt, &#x201c;Within the Context&#x201d; was a trippy string of koans that was initially published in 1980 in <i>The New Yorker</i>. It came out in book form in 1981, then got rereleased in paperback in 1997, the same year that <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer </i>debuted. As Trow saw it, television was a purely sinister force. It was a mass medium whose mass-ness was its danger, because it conflated ratings with quality, &#x201c;big&#x201d; with &#x201c;good.&#x201d; The vaster television got, the more it ate away at the decent values of mid-century America&#x2014;back when viewers were people, not demographics; adults, not children; capable of intimacy and proportion. &#x201c;Television does not vary,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;The trivial is raised up to power. The powerful is lowered toward the trivial.&#x201d; Also: &#x201c;What is loved is a hit. What is a hit is loved.&#x201d; It was an elitist screed, nostalgic for an America that had never really existed, but it had a penetrating, pungent force.<br><br>On <i>Charlie Rose </i>in 1996, novelists David Foster Wallace, Mark Leyner, and Jonathan Franzen struck an only slightly less apocalyptic note, spending nearly half of what was advertised as a panel on &#x201c;The Future of American Fiction&#x201d; denouncing television as &#x201c;a commercial art that&#x2019;s a lot of fun that requires very little of the recipient.&#x201d; Their worries about television&#x2019;s &#x201c;kinetic bursts&#x201d; were a precursor to the pseudoscientific rhetoric (&#x201c;dopamine squirts&#x201d;) that would later greet the Internet, once that stepped in as a cultural bogeyman. But then, they were part of a long tradition. In 1958, newscaster Edward R. Murrow had warned about the propagandistic dangers of the medium in his brilliant &#x201c;box of lights and wires&#x201d; speech. In the 1970s, popular jeremiads like Jerry Mander&#x2019;s <i>Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television </i>and Marie Winn&#x2019;s <i>The Plug-In Drug </i>diagnosed TV as an addiction. In the 1980s, the&nbsp;slogan &#x201c;Kill Your Television&#x201d; was a hip bumper sticker. At the turn of the century, watching TV was still widely seen, in the much-quoted (although possibly apocryphal) words of nineties comic Bill Hicks, as a spiritually harmful act, like &#x201c;taking black spray paint to your third eye.&#x201d;<br><br> There were occasional exceptions to this mood, among them Chip McGrath&#x2019;s 1995 cover story in <i>The New York Times Magazine, </i>&#x201c;The Triumph of the Prime-Time Novel,&#x201d; in which he praised <i>ER </i>and <i>Homicide: Life on the Street </i>for their &#x201c;classic American realism, the realism of Dreiser and Hopper.&#x201d; But as his title indicated, McGrath&#x2019;s argument was just the flip side of the one made by the Charlie Rose panel. TV might, in fact, be worth watching&#x2014;but only when it stopped being TV.</p><h2>The Collected Short Stories of Louis L&#39;Amour, Volume 5: Frontier Stories</h2><p>The stories of Louis L&#x2019;Amour are built around the dramatic moments when men and women cast their fears, doubts, and pasts behind them and plunge into the unknown&#x2014;into split-second decisions with life-and-death consequences.

There isn&#39;t a more complete southwestern pottery guide.</p><p>Four or five years ago two lifelong friends with a considerable amount of pocket change developed a lust for pueblo pottery. Together they visited the pueblos and villages of the Southwest, bought "insignificant" pieces from potters, traders, shops, and shows, and came up with a stunning collection. The authors write about these pots in a breezy, amusing, but well-informed style. They explain their "cheapskate" buying policy?"If it's over $40, think hard about it"?and tell what to look for in a pot. They also explain regional differences in clay and treatment and provide great maps. After discussing the styles and traditions of the past and their influence, they revisit the pueblos in alphabetical order and discuss each pueblo's style ("Where Acoma and Laguna's bird is a parrot, Zia's is a roadrunner often startled"). The authors claim "Southwestern pottery is not only one of the world's import art forms, it's the most accessible."

Who was the real Jesus? What was the original message of the charismatic Jewish healer and moralist who changed the world? There can be no doubt that Jesus, 'a religious genius' as Geza Vermes describes him, lived and taught in Palestine some 2000 years ago. The influence he has had is incalculable. How though can we distinguish between the doctrines shaped to the needs of the burgeoning Christian church and the original views laid out by Jesus himself? How can we dig back through the additions, misinterpretations and confusions of later writers and two millennia of tradition to get back to the authentic gospel of Jesus? In The Authentic Gospel of Jesus, Vermes subjects all the sayings of Jesus to brilliantly informed scrutiny. The result is a book of unique value and novelty -scraping aside the accretions of centuries to come as close as we can hope to be to the true Jesus.

Yet this often comes at the expense of the fundamental reality of the pastorate as a theological office. The most important role is to be a theologian mediating God to the people. The church needs pastors who can contextualize biblical wisdom in Christian living to help their congregations think theologically about all aspects of their lives, such as work, end-of-life decisions, political involvement, and entertainment choices.<br><br>Drawing on the Bible, key figures from church history, and Christian theology, this book offers a clarion call for pastors to serve as public theologians in their congregations and communities. It is designed to be engaging reading for busy pastors and includes pastoral reflections on the theological task from twelve working pastors, including Kevin DeYoung and Cornelius Plantinga.</p><p><b>"An important, ringing call for working pastors and preachers"<br></b><br>"This is a timely, more than timely--<i>urgent</i>--book. Kevin Vanhoozer, one of our leading theologians, protests the 'putting asunder' of theology by American pastors. A 'great chasm' has opened up as pastors, more often than not, abandon their vocations as theologians in their congregations for careers in which the secular culture calls all the shots. It was not always this way. Vanhoozer and Strachan skillfully fashion insight and discernment to bring us back to what the church ordained us to do."<br>--<b>Eugene H. Peterson</b>, Regent College, Vancouver; pastor emeritus, Christ Our King Presbyterian, Bel Air, Maryland<br><br>"Preachers today must present biblical truth to people who are more and more resistant to it. The skillful preacher must understand something of the history of ideas and the baseline cultural narratives of our day in order even to be comprehensible to them. Not only that, but preachers in our cities must often speak to people from several diverse world cultures all at once. I've come to the conclusion that ministers need more robust theological education and training than they did when I came into the ministry forty years ago. This book is an important, ringing call for working pastors and preachers to exercise a higher level of theologically informed leadership in our churches."<br>--<b>Tim Keller</b>, Redeemer Presbyterian Church, New York City<br><br>"There's not much wrong with the practice of pastoral ministry that can't be cured by a good dose of theological refurbishment. This book gives strong impetus for construing the work of the pastor as authorized, energized, and sanctified by the pastor's theological commitments. A spirited, Spirit-filled book."<br>--<b>William Willimon</b>, Duke Divinity School; retired bishop, United Methodist Church<br><br>"For years I have told students that they were too smart for the academy, that they should stretch themselves with the harder intellectual work of the parish. And here I thought I was being original. Vanhoozer and Strachan show the original and eschatological unity of two things that modernity has tried to pull apart--the vital parish and the learned pastor.

But Harry Bosch cannot resist the call to join the elite Open/Unsolved Unit. His mission: solve murders whose investigations were flawed, stalled, or abandoned to L.A.'s tides of crime. With some people openly rooting for his failure, Harry catches the case of a teenager dragged off to her death on Oat Mountain, and traces the DNA on the murder weapon to a small-time criminal. But something bigger and darker beckons, and Harry must battle to fit all the pieces together. Shaking cages and rattling ghosts, he will push the rules to the limit -- and expose the kind of truth that shatters lives, ends careers, and keeps the dead whispering in the night . . .</p><p>"A city that forgets its murder victims is a city lost. This is where we don't forget," Detective Hieronymus "Harry" Bosch is told by his new boss, as he ends a three-year retirement and rejoins the Los Angeles Police Department at the start of <i>The Closers</i>, the 11th installment of Michael Connelly's Edgar-winning series. Having long ago demonstrated his knack for cracking previously unsolved homicides, Bosch is assigned to the newly re-branded Open-Unsolved Unit (aka "cold case" squad), and charged with resolving the 17-year-old abduction and slaying of a mixed-race teenager.<p> Rebecca Verloren, 16, was discovered missing from her Chatsworth home on a July morning in 1988. Her corpse and the gun that ended her life were later found on a hill behind the house. An autopsy revealed that she'd recently undergone an abortion, and a piece of skin tissue--presumably the killer's--was found trapped inside the murder weapon. Only now, though, has DNA science matched that tissue to Roland Mackey, a dyslexic 35-year-old tow-truck operator with no obvious connection to the deceased. It's up to Bosch, once more partnered with Kizmin Rider, to determine whether Mackey offed Becky Verloren, or was at least an accessory to that tragedy. But the more Bosch and Rider dig into this dusty crime, trying in part to determine whether racial animosity might have been involved, the more pain and resistance they encounter. Becky's white mother maintains the teen's old bedroom as a shrine, while her shattered father, an African-American chef, has vanished into LA's homeless community. Of the two original investigators on the case, one has since committed suicide, and Bosch suspects that the other--now a police commander--is helping to keep the lid tight on some old departmental secrets, perhaps linked to our hero's nemesis, Deputy Chief Irvin S. Irving.</p><p> Understandably rusty after three years sans shield, Bosch makes his share of personal and professional mistakes here--including one that supplies <i>The Closers</i> with a lethal, plot-turning climax. But the greater problem is that Connelly exhausts so much time and effort following his protagonist through the tedium of modern police procedures, that he neglects what readers have liked more about this series in the past: its persistently deft exploration of Bosch's lonely, haunted soul (which remains mostly out of sight in this tale), and the author's frequent flights of lyrical prose (also not much in evidence). Would-be novelists wanting an example of a solidly constructed cop tale need look no further than <i>The Closers</i>. But readers hoping to learn why Connelly is so well-respected in this genre should turn, instead, to previous Bosch titles such as <i>The Concrete Blonde</i>, <i>Angel's Flight</i>, or <i>City of Bones</i>. <i>--J.

Michael V. Hayden (Retd.), Former Director of NSA &amp; CIA</b></p><p>In the late 1970s, the National Security Agency still did not officially exist&#x2015;those in the know referred to it dryly as the No Such Agency. So why, when NSA engineer Charles Gandy filed for a visa to visit Moscow, did the Russian Foreign Ministry assert with confidence that he was a spy? </p><p>Outsmarting honey traps and encroaching deep enough into enemy territory to perform complicated technical investigations, Gandy accomplished his mission in Russia, but discovered more than State and CIA wanted him to know. </p><p>Eric Haseltine's<i> The Spy in Moscow Station </i>tells of a time when&#x2015;much like today&#x2015;Russian spycraft had proven itself far beyond the best technology the U.S. had to offer. The perils of American arrogance mixed with bureaucratic infighting left the country unspeakably vulnerable to ultra-sophisticated Russian electronic surveillance and espionage.</p><p>This is the true story of unorthodox, underdog intelligence officers who fought an uphill battle against their own government to prove that the KGB had pulled off the most devastating penetration of U.S. national security in history.

How do we make right decisions? How do we respect the earth? How are we to view life and death? What is the path we should live to truly achieve a good and meaningful life?</p><p>For Deng Ming-Dao, the two entry points for this exploration are two words: The first is the Chinese word for &#x201c;heart&#x201d;&#x2015; which means heart, mind, intention, center, core intelligence, and soul.

She believes that we each need to become a revolutionary and <em>practice love every day. </em>And if Joyce has her way, the revolution will spread - person by person, house by house, town by town, until the old culture of selfishness and greed gives way to a new culture of concern for others. <br><br>The book is a revolutionaries' manual, a hands-on primer for bringing the Golden Rule to life in the twenty-first century. Meyer starts out by giving some stunning statistics. Right now...210,000 children will die this week because of poverty; 640 million children do not have adequate shelter; every day, 3,000 children are abducted into the sex-trafficking industry; every day, 16,000 children die from hunger-related causes. She goes on to say that although crisis is global, the solution is local. We can't solve the world's problems, but that isn't a reason to remain idle. <br><br>LOVE REVOLUTION focuses on personal behavior on the local scale. It's not just a call to action; it is a call to <em>being: </em>being the person who goes out of your way to encourage someone who's out of hope; being the one who smiles at a stranger; being the one who is willing to do something for nothing. The paradox: when we do something for nothing, what we often get is something far greater.</p><p>Joyce Meyer has been in full-time ministry since 1980. She is a #1 <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author of more than seventy inspirational books. She has also released thousands of audio teachings as well as a complete video library. Joyce's ENJOYING EVERYDAY LIFE television and radio programs are broadcast around the world, and she travels extensively conducting conferences in the US and abroad. <br><br>Joyce and her husband, Dave, are the parents of four grown children and make their home in St. Louis, Missouri.

Dr. David Bohm, who has worked alongside Oppenheimer and Einstein, and Dr. F. David Peat, author of <i>Synchronicity: The Bridge Between Matter and Mind</i>, propose a return to a greater creativity and communication in the sciences. They ask for a renewed emphasis on ideas rather than formulae, on the whole rather than fragments, on meaning rather than mere mechanics.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tracing the history of science from Aristotle to Einstein, from the Pythagorean theorem to quantum mechanics, the authors offer intriguing new insights into how scientific theories come into being, how to eliminate blocks to creativity, and how science can lead to a deeper understanding of society, the human condition, and the human mind itself. <i>Science, Order, and Creativity</i> looks to the future of science with elegance, hope, and enthusiasm. And it shows how each of us can work creatively in our own lives to help bring new meaning and order to the universe we share.</p><p>David Bohm, one of the key physicists and natural philosophers of the 20th century, was Professor of Theoretical Physics at Birkbeck University. F. David Peat is a leading science writer whose books include <i>Infinite Potential: The Life and Times of David Bohm,</i>(1997) <i>Superstrings,</i> (1989) and <i>In Search of Nikolas Tesla </i>(1998).The authors deplore the alleged tendency of modern science toward "fragmentation" and the paradigms that seem to fix the accepted structure of each science rigidly between scientific revolutions. Veteran physicist Bohm ( Quantum Theory ) has advocated a causal interpretation of quantum mechanics that is not generally accepted by other physicists. In this book, based on conversations with Peat ( Synchronicity ), Bohm's theory is reviewed in terms accessible to the lay reader, and dialogue with supporters of the standard interpretation is urged. The nature of order and blocks to scientific creativity are also addressed. For comprehensive collections in the philosophy of science. Jack W.

Young Mirandy wants to win her town's cakewalk jubilee, a festive dance contest. (According to the "Author's Note," this dance was "first introduced in America by slaves. . .and is rooted in Afro-American culture.") Everyone says that if she captures the Wind he will do her bidding, but nobody seems to know how to capture him. In the end, Mirandy does believe that she has captured Brother Wind, but she also proves that she is a true friend to clumsy Ezel. McKissack's sincere belief in the joy of living is delightfully translated into this story which concludes, "When Grandmama Beasley had seen Mirandy and Ezel turning and spinning, moving like shadows in the flickering candlelight, she'd thrown back her head, laughed, and said, 'Them chullin' is dancing with the Wind!'

Can it change the world for the better? And how much do we actually need?

The book is divided into chapters such as Dairy, Poultry and Eggs, Bread, and Preserving, and forgotten processes such as smoking mackerel, curing bacon, and making yogurt and butter are explained in the simplest terms. The delicious recipes show you how to use your homemade bounty to its best, and include ideas for using forgotten cuts of meat, baking bread and cakes, and even eating food from the wild. The Vegetables and Herbs chapter is stuffed with growing tips to satisfy even those with the smallest garden plot or window box, and there are plenty of suggestions for using gluts of vegetables. You&#39;ll even discover how to keep a few chickens in your backyard. With over 700 recipes, this is the definitive modern guide to traditional cooking skills.</p><p>Winner of the Andre Simon Food Awards Best Food Book of 2009So many of our happiest childhood memories are connected to food. Picnics by the sea, afternoon tea with Granny, Mammy's lamb stew, or treacle pudding around the kitchen table. How many times have I heard, "I remember Aunt Margie used to make a wonderful apple pie. I wish I'd asked her for the recipe." So don't leave it until it's too late. Maybe even start a little booklet of favorite family recipes and add to it from time to time. It'll make a terrific and worthwhile present for your youngsters when they eventually leave home. <p>In the past 20-30 years, many people have concentrated on careers and a certain set of academic skills. The subliminal message coming through our educational system, and in many cases from parents as well, was that cooking and gardening were skills that one shouldn't be bothered with and would never need to know. But the path of life doesn't always run smoothly and so many confident young people who were riding the crest of a wave are suddenly forced to face the reality that they are virtually helpless in a changed situation. So part of the mission of this book is to urge parents and grandparents not to allow any more of our young people to leave home without the life skills they need, not only to survive, but also to enhance the quality of their lives. With oil supplies diminishing and energy prices rising, we are likely to need these skills even more in the future. </p><p>The other reason for writing this book was to provide a resource for the growing number of farmers and food producers with excellent raw materials who are interested in adding value to their produce. There is also a new generation whose interest in artisan food production has taken them to careers in small-scale cheese making, meat curing, or beer brewing. If we want to keep them alive, we need to support them too. I hope this book will be a valuable resource for them all.</p></p><h2>Invitation to Educational Ministry: Foundations of Transformative Christian Education (Invitation to Theological Studies)</h2><p>Because teaching is at the heart of Christian ministry, the editors of <i>Invitation to Educational Ministry</i> have assembled a team of seasoned experts to present a comprehensive plan of Christian education.

To have a handbook that is this ministry-friendly and up-to-date is truly a gift to those who desire to lead church education programs that honor God.

The book addresses a range of ministry models and approaches, helping readers think more creatively about a variety of ways available to help people learn and grow.

The second chapter of James reminds us that even the demons have that. They&#x2019;re still demons! What matters is when the Bible becomes the tool God uses to grab hold of a person&#x2019;s heart and transform it into one that&#x2019;s much more like his. This is more likely to happen when the person teaching the Bible is not only passionate about its content, but also compassionate towards the people on the receiving end of their teaching. <i>Invitation to Educational Ministry</i> is all about the what, who, and how of this passionate/compassionate kind of Bible teaching&#x2015;teaching that truly transforms.&#x201d; (Tim Kimmel, Author of Grace-Based Parenting and Grace Filled Marriage 2018-06-04)<br><br>"As a young man, my heart was lit ablaze with a passion for Jesus through teachers who had a firm grip on the Word of God and a finger on the pulse of modern times.

Pull out the drain plug, and the dirty water disappears. Most of us give little thought to the hidden systems that bring us water and take it away when we&#x2019;re done with it. But these underappreciated marvels of engineering face an array of challenges that cannot be solved without a fundamental change to our relationship with water, David Sedlak explains in this enlightening book. To make informed decisions about the future, we need to understand the three revolutions in urban water systems that have occurred over the past 2,500 years and the technologies that will remake the system.&nbsp;The author starts by describing Water 1.0, the early Roman aqueducts, fountains, and sewers that made dense urban living feasible. He then details the development of drinking water and sewage treatment systems&#x2014;the second and third revolutions in urban water. He offers an insider&#x2019;s look at current systems that rely on reservoirs, underground pipe networks, treatment plants, and storm sewers to provide water that is safe to drink, before addressing how these water systems will have to be reinvented. For everyone who cares about reliable, clean, abundant water, this book is essential reading.</p><p><b>David Sedlak</b> is the Malozemoff Professor in the Department of of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, co-director of the Berkeley Water Center, and deputy director of the National Science Foundation&#x2019;s engineering research center for Reinventing the Nation&#x2019;s Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt). He is the 2014 recipient of the National Water Research Institute Clarke Prize."With the turn of a tap, clean water flows out. . . . It all seems so simple and obvious. And yet, as UC Berkeley Professor David Sedlak explains in his fact-packed new book, <i>Water 4.0</i>, such conveniences are really a marvel of engineering, built on centuries of trial and (often) error. More improvements are urgently needed as new challenges like climate change loom. So Sedlak&#x2019;s effort to engage the public on this oft-neglected subject is welcome."&#x2014;Kate Galbraith, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br>"The book is filled with intriguing historical detail. . . . Sedlak is fairly described as a technocrat (he is a professor of engineering at Berkeley), but his book stimulates political reflection as well. The urban water crises he presents &#x2014; historical and present day &#x2014; not only run up against prevailing technological possibilities; they also have engaged political debates as to how we run and pay for our cities."&#x2014;Jeffery Atik, <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i><br>The National Water Research Institute 2014 Clarke Prize consists of a medallion and $50,000 to the winner. David Sedlak was selected as the 2014 recipient because of his pioneering research on advancing the way water resources and urban water infrastructure are managed, including implementing water reuse and reducing the discharge of emerging contaminants. His work has served as the foundation for major policy and technical initiatives to reduce the effects of these contaminants and protect public health.<br>Winner of the 2014 American Publishers Awards for Professional and Scholarly Excellence (PROSE) in the Engineering &amp; Technology category<br>"David Sedlak offers a clear window into the past and a positive vision of the future for one of our most precious resources: drinking water.

It addresses these topics at a level that is deeper and more focused than what is found in typical introductory undergraduate testing and measurement texts, but is much more intuitive than what is traditionally found in the more technical publications intended for advanced graduate courses. By emphasizing concepts over mathematical proofs and by focusing on practical significance, this book assists students in appreciating not just how measurement problems can be addressed, but why it is crucial to address them.</p><p><p><b>R.

No objective historian, declared the judge, would manipulate the documentary record in the way that Irving did. Richard J. Evans, a Cambridge historian and the chief adviser for the defense, uses this famous trial as a lens for exploring a range of difficult questions about the nature of the historian&#39;s enterprise.</p><p><b>Richard J. Evans</b> is Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University and a noted specialist on modern German history. He is the author of In Defense of History and Death in Hamburg.When Deborah Lipstadt's <i>Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory</i> (1993), a groundbreaking book about the disturbing movement to refute the reality of the Holocaust, was published, one of the writers identified as a Holocaust denier, the Englishman David Irving, sued Lipstadt and her publisher, Penguin, for libel. Although Irving never earned a degree, he has written nearly 30 books about Hitler and other related subjects. His contention, therefore, was that Lipstadt had denigrated his work as a historian by accusing him of distorting the historical record to support his extreme anti-Semitic politics. The defense had to prove that Irving, in fact, had deliberately misrepresented the contents of relevant documents to conform to his sympathetic view of Hitler and his belief that nothing on the order of genocide occurred under Nazi rule. Evans, a Cambridge-based historian who specializes in modern German history, was retained by the defense as an expert witness, and he chronicles his arduous research effort with impressive lucidity. At question was the very bedrock of history: Is there such a thing as historical objectivity? Or, as Evans writes, "How do we know when a historian is telling the truth? . . . Wasn't it all a matter of interpretation?" Sensitive to these conundrums and the high emotional valence attached to the Holocaust, Evans was scrupulous in his examination of thousands of pages of documents, assiduously evaluating Irving's interpretation of such primary sources as Goebbels' diaries, always on the lookout for evidence of inaccuracies and bias. He found plenty, and he describes his discoveries with quiet and contagious excitement. By sharing his vast insider's knowledge and recounting his surreal experiences on the stand as Irving, who represented himself, conducted his chaotic cross-examinations, Evans enables readers to fully appreciate the significance of both Lipstadt's victory and Irving's exposure as exactly what he claimed not to be. There is such a thing as truth, and history, responsibly practiced, will reveal it. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Although it is very conscise, it is an informative book that covers a vast amount of material in a relatively short space without sparing the important details. Consequently, this book is very suitable for the needs of both beginners to psychology and practitioners...it comes very highly recommended to all social psychology enthusiasts.- Helen Mann, Heriot-Watt University, USA Reviews of previous editions: &#39;The ideas [Aronson] so eloquently presents are timeless in the field of social psychology...The Social Animal is a masterpiece.&#39; - Contemporary Psychology &#39;A rare gem of a book, easy to read but also scientifically sophisticated.&#39; - Contemporary Sociology &#39;The simplest, most entertaining introduction to social psychology. It is as though the reader is having a conversation with a stimulating, learned scholar with a good sense of humor.&#39; - Community College Social Science Quarterly &#39;Aronson writes with an astonishing combination of passion, wisdom, and humor.

Ekerdt is a professor and chairman in the Chemical Engineering Department at The University of Texas at Austin.</p>"The book's truly amazing. I loved its rigorous nature, generality, careful organization--rare qualities in modern reaction engineering books." -- <i>Denis Shcherbakov, graduate student, Princeton University</i></p><h2>Econometrics</h2><p><p>Hayashi's <i>Econometrics</i> promises to be the next great synthesis of modern econometrics. It introduces first year Ph.D. students to standard graduate econometrics material from a modern perspective. It covers all the standard material necessary for understanding the principal techniques of econometrics from ordinary least squares through cointegration. The book is also distinctive in developing both time-series and cross-section analysis fully, giving the reader a unified framework for understanding and integrating results.</p><br><br><p> <i>Econometrics</i> has many useful features and covers all the important topics in econometrics in a succinct manner. All the estimation techniques that could possibly be taught in a first-year graduate course, except maximum likelihood, are treated as special cases of GMM (generalized methods of moments). Maximum likelihood estimators for a variety of models (such as probit and tobit) are collected in a separate chapter. This arrangement enables students to learn various estimation techniques in an efficient manner. Eight of the ten chapters include a serious empirical application drawn from labor economics, industrial organization, domestic and international finance, and macroeconomics. These empirical exercises at the end of each chapter provide students a hands-on experience applying the techniques covered in the chapter. The exposition is rigorous yet accessible to students who have a working knowledge of very basic linear algebra and probability theory. All the results are stated as propositions, so that students can see the points of the discussion and also the conditions under which those results hold. Most propositions are proved in the text.</p><br><p> For those who intend to write a thesis on applied topics, the empirical applications of the book are a good way to learn how to conduct empirical research. For the theoretically inclined, the no-compromise treatment of the basic techniques is a good preparation for more advanced theory courses.</p></p><p><p>"Students of econometrics and their teachers will find this book to be the best introduction to the subject at the graduate and advanced undergraduate level. Starting with least squares regression, Hayashi provides an elegant exposition of all the standard topics of econometrics, including a detailed discussion of stationary and non-stationary time series. The particular strength of the book is the excellent balance between econometric theory and its applications, using GMM as an organizing principle throughout. Each chapter includes a detailed empirical example taken from classic and current applications of econometrics."<b>--Dale Jorgensen, Harvard University</b></p><p>"<i>Econometrics</i> will be a very useful book for intermediate and advanced graduate courses. It covers the topics with an easy to understand approach while at the same time offering a rigorous analysis. The computer programming tips and problems should also be useful to students. I highly recommend this book for an up-to-date coverage and thoughtful discussion of topics in the methodology and application of econometrics."<b>--Jerry A. Hausman, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b></p><p>"<i>Econometrics</i> covers both modern and classic topics without shifting gears. The coverage is quite advanced yet the presentation is simple. Hayashi brings students to the frontier of applied econometric practice through a careful and efficient discussion of modern economic theory. The empirical exercises are very useful. . . . The projects are carefully crafted and have been thoroughly debugged."<b>--Mark W. Watson, Princeton University</b></p><p>"<i>Econometrics</i> strikes a good balance between technical rigor and clear exposition. . . . The use of empirical examples is well done throughout. I very much like the use of old 'classic' examples. It gives students a sense of history--and shows that great empirical econometrics is a matter of having important ideas and good data, not just fancy new methods. . . . The style is just great, informal and engaging."<b>--James H. Stock, John F.

Stimson Lectures)</h2><p><b>A major theoretical statement by a distinguished political scholar explains why a policy of liberal hegemony is doomed to fail</b><br><br> It is widely believed in the West that the United States should spread liberal democracy across the world, foster an open international economy, and build international institutions. The policy of remaking the world in America&#x2019;s image is supposed to protect human rights, promote peace, and make the world safe for democracy. But this is not what has happened. Instead, the United States has become a highly militarized state fighting wars that undermine peace, harm human rights, and threaten liberal values at home.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this major statement, the renowned international-relations scholar John Mearsheimer argues that liberal hegemony&#x2014;the foreign policy pursued by the United States since the Cold War ended&#x2014;is doomed to fail. It makes far more sense, he maintains, for Washington to adopt a more restrained foreign policy based on a sound understanding of how nationalism and realism constrain great powers abroad. <i>The Great Delusion </i>is a lucid and compelling work of the first importance for scholars, policymakers, and everyone interested in the future of American foreign policy.</p><p><b>John J.

Recent scientific discoveries show that the information that upholds all of our modern technologies is exactly the same as the universal in-formation that underpins, pervades, and is all we call physical reality.<br><br>Exploring how information is more fundamental than energy, matter, space, or time, Jude Currivan, Ph.D., examines the latest research across many fields of study and many scales of existence to show how our Universe is in-formed and holographically manifested. She explains how the fractal in-formational patterns that guide behavior at the atomic level also guide the structure of galactic clusters in space. She demonstrates how the in-formational relationships that underlie earthquakes are the same as those that play out during human conflicts. She shows how cities grow in the same in-formational ways that galaxies evolve and how the dynamic in-formational forms that pervade ecosystems are identical to the informational structures of the Internet and our social behaviors. Demonstrating how information is physically real, the author explores how consciousness connects us to the many interconnected layers of universal in-formation, making us both manifestations and co-creators of the cosmic hologram of reality. She explains how Quantum Mechanics and Einstein&#x2019;s Theory of Relativity can at last be reconciled if we consider energy-matter and space-time as complementary expressions of information, and she explores how the cosmic hologram underlies the true origin of species and our own evolution.<br><br>Concurring too with ancient spiritual wisdom, the author offers solid evidence that consciousness is not something we &#x201c;have&#x201d; but the fundamental nature of what we and the entire Universe are. With this understanding, we can each transform our own lives and help co-create and in-form the world around us.</p><p>Jude Currivan, Ph.D., is a cosmologist, futurist, planetary healer and previously one of the most senior business women in the UK.

Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder what makes the Universe exist. Be curious.</i> <br> --Stephen Hawking, physicist<b> <br></b> <br><b>Real-izing</b> <br> <br>Neuroscientists, psychologists, and psychiatrists are coming to recognize that we don&#x2019;t perceive a direct representation of &#x201c;external&#x201d; reality but, instead, our senses and brains operate as a translation and integration service to our innate consciousness. What we think, feel, and believe, whether it&#x2019;s &#x201c;true&#x201d; or not, significantly affects our notions of what&#x2019;s real. <br> <br>The old adage &#x201c;seeing is believing,&#x201d; is being turned on its head as studies are progressively discovering that we literally &#x201c;see&#x201d; what we believe. <br> <br>Numerous experiments have shown that we see what we expect to see. Psychologists have demonstrated that when our attention is distracted we miss otherwise obvious events and co-create the realities we perceive--traits often expertly manipulated by mentalists such as the UK&#x2019;s Derren Brown.<b> <br> <br></b>A well-known (and jaw-dropping) example is the phenomenon of &#x201c;change blindness,&#x201d; an experiment on which was carried out by psychologists Daniel Simons and Daniel Levin in 1998. Such reality myopia occurs when our attention is diverted. Researchers have concluded that change blindness is due to a lack of informational attention before and after the distraction. The brain fills in the gaps and concludes that no change has occurred, even when it actually has.<b> <br> <br></b>Simons and Levin&#x2019;s research was conducted at Cornell University where experimenters held a campus map and asked passers-by for directions. After around fifteen seconds into a person&#x2019;s directions, two further experimenters, together carrying a door, walked in between the conversation. As they were moving on, the initial experimenter who&#x2019;d been asking the way switched places with the one carrying the back of the door, who then took the place in receiving help from the passers-by.<b> <br> <br></b>When the passers-by completed their directions, the experimenter explained that a psychological study of how people pay attention was being undertaken. Asking whether the passers-by had noticed anything unusual when the two people carrying the door went by, if the response was no, the experimenter then asked whether the passers-by had realized that they weren&#x2019;t speaking with the same person who&#x2019;d initially approached them and was previously being given assistance.<b> <br> <br></b>Over half the passers-by failed to notice that the person they had been speaking with had changed to another stranger in the middle of their conversation!<b> <br> <br></b>Scientists over the last couple of decades have also tested how what we think and believe actually alters our physiology. <br> <br>For Eastern practitioners of mind-based traditions, such abilities have always been self-evident, but in recent years Western scientists have studied and increasingly corroborated such claims. <br> <br>In 2002, the <i>Harvard Gazette</i> reported a series of experiments beginning in the 1980s, and directed by Herbert Benson of the Harvard Medical School, that investigated the Tibetan Buddhism meditative practice of <i>tum-mo</i>. Not only were the monks involved in the experiments <br>able to demonstrate a conscious ability to reduce their metabolism by up to sixty-four percent but also to significantly raise their body temperatures. Translated as &#x201c;inner fire,&#x201d; tum-mo&#x2019;s visualization and focusing technique has been used for many centuries as a rite of passage to prove a monk&#x2019;s aptitude by being able to survive and thrive in the inhospitably low temperatures of their homeland. Adepts are even able to produce sufficient inner heat to cope with a night-long meditation in the freezing cold, sitting naked on the snow. <br> <br>Due to the spiritual practices homed over millennia, Hindu yogis are also now being subjected to scientific investigation of their renowned powers to control bodily pain through the power of thought. <br> <br>In 2004 a team of researchers, with lead author Erik Peper of the San Francisco State University, reported their study of a yoga master able to pierce his tongue and neck with skewers while suffering neither pain nor bleeding. Experimental measures showed that a coherently high level of alpha brain-waves, associated with deep yet alert relaxation, revealed his ability to consciously reduce the electrical activity in his skin, thus reducing pain response and blood flow. (1) <br> <br><b>BEYOND THE BRAIN <br> <br></b>Real-izing that everything we call physical reality is the expression of the in-formational intelligence of cosmic mind completely reframes the question of human and, indeed, all consciousness and cognizance. <br> <br>Hitherto, the view of most neuroscientists has been that our consciousness somehow arises from the brain as a localized phenomenon. Just as a turbine generates energy, so the view goes our brain generates consciousness, somehow. <br> <br>That final &#x201c;somehow&#x201d; is crucial. While neuroscience has managed to map neural networks in the brain, identifying which areas light up during certain mental processes and progressively noting their holographic nature, there remains no mechanism for the integration of neuronal activities with the immaterial perception of self-awareness.<b> <br> <br></b>Based on numerous experimental data on the nonlocality of our consciousness, an alternative has been to view the brain instead as a computer: a receiver and transmitter of nonlocal information <br> <br>However, with increasing discoveries and the emerging understanding of the cosmic hologram, the computer-brain-mind metaphor is also coming to be seen as too limited in its perspective. Not only does it fail to account for the inter-dimensional communications reported extensively by transpersonal experiencers, but still more fundamentally, it implicitly suggests a duality between the physical world and consciousness. <br><br>Instead, the paradigm-shifting view of the cosmic hologram, whose perception recognizes the actual immateriality of the physical realm and the ultimate unity of consciousness, is offering a new view of the brain and its purpose.<br><br>By identifying the brain as playing an important role in the in-formational <i>organization </i>of the embodied awareness of human beings, it redefines each of us as a unique and microcosmic individuation of the intelligence of the cosmic hologram of our Universe: literal co-creators of reality.<br><br>Given too that, as we&#x2019;ve seen, the cosmic hologram of our universal experience is inherently nonlocally and holographically connected, our consciousness too is so nonlocally infused.</p><h2>The Practice Book for Conceptual Physics</h2><p>This book is filled with computational exercise, misconception-busting questions, analogies, and straightforward practice questions and problems that help students tie it all together.</p><p>Paul G.

Ebenezer Scrooge is a mean, miserable, bitter old man with no friends. One cold Christmas Eve, three ghosts take him on a scary journey to show him the error of his nasty ways. By visiting his past, present and future, Scrooge learns to love Christmas and the people all around him. Introducted by bestselling author Anthony Horowitz, creator of the highly successful Alex Rider novels.</p><p>In the history of English literature, Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, which has been continuously in print since it was first published in the winter of 1843, stands out as the quintessential Christmas story. What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>AMERICAN LITERATURE STUDENT TEXT</h2><p><p><strong>Access to a broad range of literature</strong> </p><p>This textbook captures over 400 years of America&#x2019;s literary history.

Torrey longed for more Christian workers to take an active part in bringing the message of salvation through Christ to a lost and dying world. His straightforward style of evangelism has shown thousands of Christian workers how to become effective soulwinners.</p><h2>Sonography: Introduction to Normal Structure and Function</h2><p><p>Without a thorough knowledge of the appearance of normal anatomy, you may have a tough time recognizing abnormalities in ultrasound images.

Olson thematically traces the contours of Christian belief down through the ages, revealing a pattern of both unity and diversity. He finds a consensus of teaching that is both unitive and able to incorporate a faithful diversity when not forced into the molds of false either-or alternatives. The mosaic that emerges from Olson's work, now updated throughout and with a new chapter on the Holy Spirit, displays a mediating evangelical theology that is irenic in spirit and tone. Olson, writing with nonspecialists in mind, has masterfully sketched out the contours of the Great Tradition of the Christian faith with simplicity while avoiding oversimplification.</p><p><strong>Roger E. Olson</strong> is professor of theology at George W. Truett Theological Seminary of Baylor University, Waco, Texas. He is author of <em>The Story of Christian Theology:</em>and <em>The Journey of Modern Theology</em>."This book serves as an excellent thematic introduction to what Christians have historically believed." (Andrew K. Gabriel, The Pneuma Review, October 24, 2016)<br><br>"What evangelicals have needed, and what [Olson] has provided, is a basic, relatively comprehensive, nontechnical, nonspeculative one-volume introduction to the Christian faith. The book offers a mediating and Arminian perspective within the broad evangelical tradition that underlines both shared beliefs and real diversity. At a time of extreme opinion, it is a godsend." (Clark Pinnock, author of Flame of Love)<br><br>"This book helps us to appreciate all the diverse theological colors that make up the mosaic called 'the Christian faith' while showing us where and why certain beliefs don't fit the pattern." (Dennis Okholm, Azusa Pacific University)<br><br>"The book is written in language that should be accessible to undergraduate students and serious-minded church members and will, hopefully, help to stem the tide of theological ignorance that threatens the health of the church." (Terrance Tiessen, Providence Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Anyone seeking help in maintaining a commitment to the truth of the gospel while also embracing genuine Christian diversity will find no better guide than this book." (Jonathan Wilson, Regent College)</p><h2>Air &amp; Light &amp; Time &amp; Space: How Successful Academics Write</h2><p><p>From the author of <i>Stylish Academic Writing</i> comes an essential new guide for writers aspiring to become more productive and take greater pleasure in their craft. Helen Sword interviewed one hundred academics worldwide about their writing background and practices. Relatively few were trained as writers, she found, and yet all have developed strategies to thrive in their publish-or-perish environment.</p><p>So how do these successful academics write, and where do they find the &#x201c;air and light and time and space,&#x201d; in the words of poet Charles Bukowski, to get their writing done? What are their formative experiences, their daily routines, their habits of mind? How do they summon up the courage to take intellectual risks and the resilience to deal with rejection?</p><p>Sword identifies four cornerstones that anchor any successful writing practice: <i>B</i>ehavioral habits of discipline and persistence; <i>A</i>rtisanal habits of craftsmanship and care; <i>S</i>ocial habits of collegiality and collaboration; and <i>E</i>motional habits of positivity and pleasure. Building on this &#x201c;BASE,&#x201d; she illuminates the emotional complexity of the writing process and exposes the lack of writing support typically available to early-career academics. She also lays to rest the myth that academics must produce safe, conventional prose or risk professional failure. The successful writers profiled here tell stories of intellectual passions indulged, disciplinary conventions subverted, and risk-taking rewarded. Grounded in empirical research and focused on sustainable change, <i>Air &amp; Light &amp; Time &amp; Space</i> offers a customizable blueprint for refreshing personal habits and creating a collegial environment where all writers can flourish.</p></p><p>Helen Sword is Professor and Director of the Centre for Learning and Research in Higher Education at the University of Auckland.&#x201c;Helen Sword delightfully shows that, contrary to lazy opinion, academics do not have to write in soggy, wooden, leaden, stuffy, turgid, or bloated prose. She makes the case with insightful analyses and lighthearted interviews, but her own prose is as good an illustration as any.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Steven Pinker, author of <i>The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person&#x2019;s Guide to Writing in the 21st Century</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Like Tolstoy&#x2019;s families, happy writers are alike (and also, perhaps, nonexistent); struggling writers, however, suffer in their own ways. Helen Sword shows the diversity of productive academics&#x2019; writing practices and serves up a range of useful strategies to help those who find writing painful succeed in getting words on the page and even&#x2015;believe it or not&#x2015;bring some pleasure to the process.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Rachel Toor, author of <i>Misunderstood: Why the Humble Rat May be Your Best Pet Ever</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Helen Sword does it again. In an age of academic doom, she inspires. Here she manages to be both data-driven and delightful: you have to read to see how she combines so much evidence and so much pleasure. She makes you want to consume creative academic writing&#x2015;not just hers&#x2015;and to try to produce nothing less.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Brian Boyd, author of <i>Why Lyrics Last: Evolution, Cognition, and Shakespeare's Sonnets</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Part how-to-write manual and part rigorous study. Filled with tidbits, quotes, profiles, and anecdotes, it shines light on academic writing from a writer&#x2019;s perspective, revealing the idiosyncrasies, rituals, and practices that make writers out of scholars.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Gricel Dominguez</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Sword&#x2019;s] approach is a refreshing break from the conventions of a genre that offers neat, one-size-fits-all solutions to writers&#x2019; struggles...The real triumph of Sword&#x2019;s book stems from the extensive interviews she&#x2019;s conducted with 100 prominent academic writers and editors.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Maximillian Alvarez</b><b>, </b><b><i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;I strongly recommend <i>Air &amp; Light &amp; Time &amp; Space</i> for anyone who would like to experiment with, and think more deeply about, their writing practices.

But in fact what William Faulkner is really after in his legendary novel is the kaleidoscope of consciousness--the overwrought mind caught in the act of thought. His rich, dark, scandal-ridden story of squandered fortune, incest (in thought if not in deed), madness, congenital brain damage, theft, illegitimacy, and stoic endurance is told in the interior voices of three Compson brothers: first Benjy, the "idiot" man-child who blurs together three decades of inchoate sensations as he stalks the fringes of the family's former pasture; next Quentin, torturing himself brilliantly, obsessively over Caddy's lost virginity and his own failure to recover the family's honor as he wanders around the seedy fringes of Boston; and finally Jason, heartless, shrewd, sneaking, nursing a perpetual sense of injury and outrage against his outrageous family. <p> If Benjy's section is the most daringly experimental, Jason's is the most harrowing. "Once a bitch always a bitch, what I say," he begins, lacing into Caddy's illegitimate daughter, and then proceeds to hurl mud at blacks, Jews, his sacred Compson ancestors, his glamorous, promiscuous sister, his doomed brother Quentin, his ailing mother, and the long-suffering black servant Dilsey who holds the family together by sheer force of character.</p> <p> Notoriously "difficult," <i>The Sound and the Fury</i> is actually one of Faulkner's more accessible works once you get past the abrupt, unannounced time shifts--and certainly the most powerful emotionally. Everything is here: the complex equilibrium of pre-civil rights race relations; the conflict between Yankee capitalism and Southern agrarian values; a meditation on time, consciousness, and Western philosophy. And all of it is rendered in prose so gorgeous it can take your breath away. Here, for instance, Quentin recalls an autumnal encounter back home with the old black possum hunter Uncle Louis: </p> <blockquote> And we'd sit in the dry leaves that whispered a little with the slow respiration of our waiting and with the slow breathing of the earth and the windless October, the rank smell of the lantern fouling the brittle air, listening to the dogs and to the echo of Louis' voice dying away. He never raised it, yet on a still night we have heard it from our front porch. When he called the dogs in he sounded just like the horn he carried slung on his shoulder and never used, but clearer, mellower, as though his voice were a part of darkness and silence, coiling out of it, coiling into it again. WhoOoooo. WhoOoooo. WhoOooooooooooooooo. </blockquote> What Faulkner has created is a modernist epic in which characters assume the stature of gods and the primal family events resonate like myths. It is <i>The Sound and the Fury</i> that secures his place in what Edmund Wilson called "the full-dressed post-Flaubert group of Conrad, Joyce, and Proust." <i>--David Laskin</i>First published in 1929, Faulkner created his "heart's darling," the beautiful and tragic Caddy Compson, whose story Faulkner told through separate monologues by her three brothers--the idiot Benjy, the neurotic suicidal Quentin and the monstrous Jason. <p>"From the Trade Paperback edition.</p></p><h2>Arboriculture: Integrated Management of Landscape Trees, Shrubs, and Vines</h2><p>Regarded by many as an irreplaceable reference tool, this book describes the integration of the landscape environment (climate, soil, and related organisms), its effect on landscape plants, and how to manage both to obtain the desired results with reasonable effort. All aspects of tree, shrub, and vine care are covered, including plant structure and function, plant selection, site analysis and preparation, environmental influences on growth, soil, water and nutrient management, pruning, transplanting, and plant health care. A valuable handbook for professionals, including arboricultural consultants, arborists, urban foresters, landscape architects, landscape contractors (installation and/or maintenance), state and county horticultural extension advisors, park directors and staff (federal, state, regional, and local), street tree superintendents and staff, grounds superintendents and staff (golf courses, college and school grounds, cemeteries, condominiums, re</p><p><p> A comprehensive guide to the care of trees, this book covers all aspects of arboriculture from the fundamentals of tree growth and development to developing plant health care programs. It discusses aspects of site selection and modification including climate, and soil and water management. The book follows the tree from selection in the nursery to planting and aftercare through such routine practices as pruning, fertilization, support systems, and plant health care. Key management situations such as tree preservation, hazard assessment, and problem diagnosis are discussed in detail. </p> <p> The fourth edition offers several new features that the student of arboriculture and practicing arborists will find valuable: </p> <ul> <li>Reorganization of topics to improve continuity of information</li> <li>Addition of overviews and summaries for each chapter</li> <li>Updated assessment of tree care practices such as soil amendments, mycorrhizae, and tree growth regulators</li> <li>Thorough evaluation of the benefits from trees (economic, environmental, ecological, and psychological) including examples of the most recent research on cost-benefit analysis of trees in urban areas</li> <li>Emphasis on special management situations such as structural soils, root-pavement conflicts, and remnant forests</li> </ul><p> Twenty years have past since the publication of the first edition. During that time arboriculture has experienced significant changes. Research findings; the application, training, and certification of arborists; innovations by practitioners; new and improved equipment and products; a worldwide community of professionals; and a better informed and more concerned public bode well for the future of arboriculture. Instant access to information across the Internet allows for exchange of ideas and experiences among arborists in every part of the globe. </p> <p> The fourth edition of <i>Arboriculture</i> provides approaches to analyzing problems and situations and selecting the most appropriate solutions or courses of action. This is particularly important because local or regional factors require specific solutions. As in previous editions, new information and maintenance practices are evaluated and, where appropriate, current practices reassessed. The analytical approach is emphasized, assessing management needs and deciding on an appropriate solution. </p> <p> The common and botanical names used generally conform to those listed in <i>Hortus Third</i> (Bailey and others, 1976) and the <i>Annotated Checklist of Woody Ornamental Plants of California, Oregon,</i> and <i>Washington</i> (McClintock and Leiser, 1979). </p> <p> Measurements are given in metric units, followed by English equivalents in parentheses. In many situations, approximate values are accurate enough, so conversions between the two systems are rounded for simplicity. </p></p><h2>1000 Buddhas of Genius (Book)</h2><p>Buddha ranks among the most often depicted holy figures of the world, perhaps appearing more than Christ.

The book makes clear that applied microeconometrics is about the estimation of marginal and treatment effects, and that parametric estimation is simply a means to this end. It also clarifies the distinction between causality and statistical association.<br> <br> The book focuses specifically on cross section and panel data methods. Population assumptions are stated separately from sampling assumptions, leading to simple statements as well as to important insights. The unified approach to linear and nonlinear models and to cross section and panel data enables straightforward coverage of more advanced methods. The numerous end-of-chapter problems are an important component of the book. Some problems contain important points not fully described in the text, and others cover new ideas that can be analyzed using tools presented in the current and previous chapters.

He wrote four massive novels, combining passages of over-the-top bad writing with some of the most beautiful prose ever committed to paper. His editors Maxwell Perkins and Edward Aswell became almost as famous as Wolfe for their Herculean efforts in getting his titanic manuscripts into publishable form. Look Homeward, Angel (1929), Of Time and the River (1935), and his two posthumously published works, The Web and the Rock (1939) and You Can&#39;t Go Home Again (1940) are classics of American literature, though today entirely unfashionable.

With the ever-increasing role of media in both reporting crime and shaping it into infotainment, the importance of the interplay between contemporary media and the criminal justice system is greater today than ever before. Author Ray Surette comprehensively surveys this interplay and showcases its impact, emphasizing that people use media-provided knowledge to construct a picture of the world and then act based on this constructed reality. He also provides a bridge between relevant mass media research findings and criminal justice practice, and corrects common misconceptions about the mass media&#39;s effects on crime and justice.</p><p>Ray Surette has a doctorate in criminology from Florida State University and is a Professor of Criminal Justice at the University of Central Florida. His crime and media research interests revolve around the media&#39;s effects on perceptions of crime and justice, criminogenic media, and criminal justice policies. He has published numerous articles and books on media, crime, and criminal justice topics and is internationally recognized as a scholar in the area. He has published research on the development of public information officers in criminal justice agencies, crime and justice infotainment programming, copycat crime, the effects of news coverage of high profile trials on similarly charged non-publicized trials and on police recruits, the effects of news coverage of corrections on municipal jail population trends, media oriented terrorism, and the use of computer-aided camera surveillance systems in law enforcement.

Tolkien Created a New Mythology</h2><p><p>The Road to Middle-earth, Tom Shippey&#x2019;s classic work, now revised in paperback, explores J.R.R. Tolkien&#x2019;s creativity and the sources of his inspiration. Shippey shows in detail how Tolkien&#x2019;s professional background led him to write The Hobbit and how he created a timeless charm for millions of readers. Examining the foundation of Tolkien&#x2019;s most popular work, The Lord of the Rings, Shippey also discusses the contribution of The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales to Tolkien&#x2019;s great myth cycle, showing how Tolkien&#x2019;s more &#x201c;difficult&#x201d; books can be fully appreciated. He goes on to examine the remarkable twelve-volume History of Middle-earth, written by Tolkien&#x2019;s son and literary heir Christopher Tolkien, which traces the creative and technical processes by which Middle-earth evolved.</p></p><p><p>Tom Shippey taught at Oxford University at the same time as J.R.R. Tolkien and with the same syllabus, which gives him an intimate familiarity with the works that fueled Tolkien's imagination. He subsequently held the chair of English language and medieval literature at Leeds University that Tolkien had previously held.</p>PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION<br><br>My involvement with Tolkien"s fiction<br>now goes back almost fifty years, to a <br>first reading of The Hobbit some time in<br>the mid-1950s. My first attempt to <br>comment publicly on Tolkien did not<br>come, however, till late 1969 or early <br>1970, when I was recruited, as a very<br>junior lecturer at the University of <br>Birmingham, to speak on "Tolkien as<br>philologist" at a Tolkien day organised <br>by some now-forgotten association. It<br>was my good fortune that Tolkien"s <br>secretary, Joy Hill, was in the<br>audience, and asked me for a copy of my <br>script to show the Professor. It was my<br>further good fortune that he read it, <br>perhaps out of good will to Birmingham<br>and to King Edward"s School, <br>Birmingham, which we both attended, he<br>(with a gap) from 1900 to 1911, and <br>I from 1954 to 1960. Tolkien furthermore<br>replied to it, with his habitual <br>courtesy, in a letter dated 13 April<br>1970, though it took me a very long time <br>to understand what he meant, as I<br>discuss below.<br> It was not till 1972 that I met Tolkien<br>in person, by which time I <br>had been promoted from Birmingham to a<br>Fellowship at St. John"s College, <br>Oxford, to teach Old and Middle English<br>along the lines which Tolkien had <br>laid down many years before. Just after<br>I arrived in Oxford, Tolkien"s <br>successor in the Merton Chair of English<br>Language, Norman Davis, invited <br>me to dine at Merton and meet Tolkien,<br>who was then living in college <br>lodgings following the death of his<br>wife. The meeting left me with a strong <br>sense of obligation and even<br>professional piety, in the old sense of<br>that word, i.e. "affectionate loyalty and respect,<br>esp. to parents", or in this case <br>predecessors. After Tolkien"s death I<br>felt increasingly that he would not have <br>been happy with many of the things<br>people said about his writings, and that <br>someone with a similar background to his<br>own ought to try to provide&#x2014;as <br>Tolkien and E. V. Gordon wrote in the<br>"Preface" to their 1925 edition of Sir <br>Gawain and the Green Knight&#x2014;"a<br>sufficient apparatus for reading [these <br>remarkable works] with an appreciation<br>as far as possible of the sort which <br>its author may be supposed to have desired".<br> In 1975, accordingly, I contributed an<br>article on "Creation from <br>Philology in The Lord of the Rings" to<br>the volume of Essays in Memoriam <br>edited by Mary Salu and R. T. Farrell,<br>essentially an expansion of my 1970 <br>script. In 1979, however, I followed<br>Tolkien"s track yet again, this time going <br>to the Chair of English Language and<br>Medieval English Literature at the <br>University of Leeds, which Tolkien had<br>held more than fifty years before. This <br>only increased the sense of professional<br>piety mentioned above, and the <br>result was the first edition of the<br>present work, which appeared in 1982. I <br>assumed at the time that that would be<br>my last word on the subject. But <br>since then, of course, the whole<br>"History of Middle-earth" has appeared, <br>twelve volumes of Tolkien"s unpublished<br>drafts and stories edited by his son <br>Christopher, as well as a volume of<br>academic essays including some new <br>material, and the "reconstructed"<br>editions of the Old English Exodus and <br>Finnsburg poems: each separate<br>publication a valuable source of<br>information, but also of some trepidation to the<br>writer who has committed himself to <br>explaining "how Tolkien worked" or "what<br>Tolkien must have been thinking". A <br>second edition of The Road to<br>Middleearth, in 1992, accordingly tried<br>to take some of this material into account.<br> A further thought, however, had slowly<br>been growing upon me, first expressed in the<br>article on "Tolkien as a Post-War Writer", <br>delivered as a lecture at the "Tolkien Phenomenon"<br>conference at the University of Turku, <br>Finland, in 1992, and printed in the<br>proceedings of that conference, <br>Scholarship and Fantasy, edited by Keith<br>J. Battarbee. This thought was that <br>I had from 1970 always thought of<br>Tolkien as a philologist, a professional <br>ancestor, one of a line of historical<br>linguists descended essentially from <br>Jacob Grimm, of "Grimm"s Law" and<br>"Grimms" Fairy Tales". I had in other <br>words habitually seen him, to use the<br>linguists" term, "diachronically". But <br>language can and should also be viewed<br>"synchronically", and so could <br>Tolkien. What happened if one considered<br>him in the literary context of his <br>time, the early to mid-twentieth<br>century? My unconsidered assumption had <br>been that he had no literary context,<br>that he was a "one-off "&#x2014;certainly the <br>impression one would get from reading<br>any literary histories of the period <br>which happened to mention him. But if<br>one reflected on Orwell and William <br>Golding, Vonnegut and T. H. White, C. S.<br>Lewis and even Ursula Le Guin, <br>several of them close to him in age or<br>experience or date of publication, a <br>different picture emerged: one of a<br>group of (as I have called <br>them) "traumatised authors", writing<br>fantasy, but voicing in that fantasy the <br>most pressing and most immediately<br>relevant issues of the whole monstrous <br>twentieth century&#x2014;questions of<br>industrialised warfare, the origin of<br>evil, the nature of humanity. This "synchronic"<br>view of Tolkien took shape in my book <br>J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century<br>(2000). (Grammarians will note the <br>absence of an article before the first<br>word of the sub-title.) I hope that my two <br>books now complement each other through<br>their different approaches, though <br>they present essentially the same<br>explanations of the central works.<br> The present, third edition of The Road<br>to Middle-earth naturally allows and obliges some<br>reconsiderations, especially as a result<br>of the new information contained in "The History of<br>Middle-earth". On the whole I feel my <br>first edition got off relatively lightly, confirmed as often as<br>disproved. The rolling years and volumes have allowed<br>me some clear hits: "angel" as Tolkien-<br>speech for messenger (see note 11 to<br>chapter 5 below, and c.p. Treason of <br>Isengard, p. 422), or the importance of<br>Old Mercian (see below p. 123 and <br>c.p. Sauron Defeated, p. 257). Of course<br>when it comes to philology, a real <br>discipline, one ought to get things<br>right. I was pleased when Anders <br>Stenstr�m, staying with me in Leeds in<br>1984, found in a Leeds journal for <br>1922 an anonymous poem in Middle English<br>which we concluded was by <br>Tolkien; but almost as pleased when the<br>emendations I proposed to the text <br>as (mis)printed were confirmed by<br>Christopher Tolkien from his father"s <br>manuscript (see the journal of the<br>Swedish Tolkien Society, Arda, vols. 4 [for <br>1984] and 6 [for 1986], for the poem and<br>Stenstr�m"s account of his search).<br> Meanwhile, some unmistakable wides have<br>also been called: in <br>my allegorisation of "Leaf by Niggle",<br>on p. 44 below, I should not have <br>written "his "Tree" = The Lord of the<br>Rings", but have put down something <br>much more extensive; despite p. 76,<br>Sauron was not part of <br>Tolkien"s "subsequent inspiration" but<br>there already; while on p. 271, <br>writing "There is, in a way, no more of<br>"middle-earth" to consider" was just <br>tempting Providence. Even more<br>significantly, my 1982 discussion of<br>"depth" in Tolkien, pp. 308&#x2013;17 below, was<br>extensively answered by Christopher <br>Tolkien a year later in his "Foreword"<br>to The Book of Lost Tales, Part 1, pp. 1&#x2013;<br>5, with a further note in Part 2, p. 57.<br>It is clear that all my discussions of <br>Tolkien were affected by reading his<br>works (as almost everyone does) in <br>order of publication, not order of<br>composition. It is a temptation to try to <br>remedy this retrospectively, but I have<br>not done so. Studying Tolkien"s fiction <br>as it developed in his own mind,<br>possible now as it was not in 1982,<br>would be a different book. In general, then, I am<br>happy to stand by what I published in <br>1982, and again in 1992, remembering the<br>data I had, and expanding or <br>updating wherever necessary.<br> Yet I do turn back to the letter<br>Professor Tolkien wrote to me on <br>13 April 1970, charmingly courteous and<br>even flattering as it was from one at <br>the top of his profession to one then at<br>the bottom ("I don"t like to fob people <br>off with a formal thanks . . . one of<br>the nearest to my heart, or the nearest, of <br>the many I have received . . . I am<br>honoured to have received your attention"). <br>And yet, and yet . . . What I should<br>have realised&#x2014;perhaps did half-realise, <br>for I speak the dialect myself&#x2014;was that<br>this letter was written in the <br>specialised politeness-language of Old<br>Western Man, in which doubt and <br>correction are in direct proportion to<br>the obliquity of expression. The <br>Professor"s letter had invisible italics<br>in it, which I now supply. "I amin <br>agreement with nearly all that you say,<br>and I only regret that I have not the <br>time to talk more about your paper:<br>especially about design as it appears or <br>may be found in a large finished work,<br>and the actual events or experiences <br>as seen or felt by the waking mind in<br>the course of actual composition". It <br>has taken me thirty years (and the<br>perusal of fifteen volumes unpublished in <br>1970) to see the point of the italics.<br>Tolkien, however, closed his letter to me <br>with the proverb: "Need brooks no delay,<br>yet late is better than never?" I can <br>only repeat his saying, question-mark<br>and all.<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Tom Shippey.<br>Reprinted by permission of Houghton <br>Mifflin Company.</p><h2>The Riddle of Amish Culture (Center Books in Anabaptist Studies)</h2><p><p>Since its publication in 1989, <i>The Riddle of Amish Culture</i> has become recognized as a classic work on one of America's most distinctive religious communities.

For this revised edition, Donald B. Kraybill has taken these recent changes into account, incorporating new demographic research and new interviews he has conducted among the Amish.

The Eighth Edition thoroughly analyzes 17 leading systems of psychotherapy and briefly surveys another 31, thereby providing a broader scope than is available in most books. The authors explore each system&#39;s theory of personality, theory of psychopathology, and resulting therapeutic process and therapy relationship. By doing so, they demonstrate how much psychotherapy systems agree on the processes producing change, while showing how they disagree on the content that needs to be changed. To bring these similarities and differences to life, the authors also present the limitations, practicalities, and outcome research of each system of psychotherapy.

It draws on and expands the ideas of his previous work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, but with a more critical and polemical approach. In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche accuses past philosophers of lacking critical sense and blindly accepting dogmatic premises in their consideration of morality. Specifically, he accuses them of founding grand metaphysical systems upon the faith that the good man is the opposite of the evil man, rather than just a different expression of the same basic impulses that find more direct expression in the evil man. The work moves into the realm &#34;beyond good and evil&#34; in the sense of leaving behind the traditional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a destructive critique in favour of what he regards as an affirmative approach that fearlessly confronts the perspectival nature of knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual.</p><p>Nietzsche has been proclaimed the seminal figure of modern philosophy as well as one of the most creative and critically influential geniuses in the history of secular thought.</p><h2>Basics of Qualitative Research: Second Edition: Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory</h2><p><p>The<b> Second Edition</b> of this best-selling textbook continues to offer immensely practical advice and technical expertise that will aid researchers in analyzing and interpreting their collected data, and ultimately build theory from it.

It provides a fundamental knowledge that is a prerequisite to meeting the many natural-resource challenges awaiting humanity in the 21st century. For individuals who study the science of soil, and those who make a profession of it.</p><p><p> A fundamental knowledge of soil science is not only intriguing&#x2014;it is also a prerequisite to meeting the many natural resource challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. This text addresses all of the basic principles of soil science, emphasizing the soil as a natural resource and highlighting the many interactions between the soil and other components of forest, range, agricultural, wetland, and constructed ecosystems. </p> <p> <i>Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils, Second Edition,</i> is suitable as the core text in an introductory soil science course at the undergraduate level, providing authoritative and up-to-date coverage that is essential for a solid foundation in the study of soils. It is also an excellent resource for anyone interested in the study of soils. Following are only a few of the topics covered: </p> <ul> <li>formation of soils</li> <li>soil classification</li> <li>soil architecture and physical properties</li> <li>soil water</li> <li>soil and the hydrologic cycle</li> <li>soil aeration and temperature</li> <li>the colloidal fraction: seat of soil chemical and physical activity</li> <li>soil acidity, alkalinity, and salinity</li> <li>organisms and ecology of the soil</li> <li>soil organic matter</li> <li>nitrogen and sulfur economy of soil</li> <li>soil phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients</li> <li>practical nutrient management</li> <li>soil erosion and its control</li> </ul><p> Like mountains or lakes, soils are both natural bodies in the landscape and ecosystems in their own right. Soils are among our most important natural resources. Soil science therefore lies at the heart of terrestrial ecology; understanding the soil system is key to the success and environmental harmony of any human use of the land. </p> <p> This textbook is designed to help make your study of soils a fascinating and intellectually satisfying undertaking. We are confident that much of what you learn will be of enormous practical value in equipping you to meet the natural resource challenges of the 21st century. Whether your interests lie in forestry, agriculture, ecology, geography, or landscaping, you will soon find that soil science is critical to solving a wide range of problems relevant to these and similar fields. Because soil science integrates concepts from physics, chemistry, geology, and biology, this textbook will provide many opportunities for you to see practical applications for principles from these and other basic sciences. </p> <p> As is the case for its parent book, <i>The Nature and Properties of Soils,</i> 13th edition, this newest edition of <i>Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils</i> explains the fundamental principles of soil science in a manner that you will find relevant to your interests. Throughout, the text emphasizes the soil as a natural resource and highlights the many interactions between the soil and other components of forest, range, agricultural, wetland, and constructed ecosystems. We have sought to craft a book that will serve your needs well, whether your reading this textbook is to be your only formal exposure to soil science or you are embarking on a comprehensive soil science education. This new textbook is meant to provide both an exciting, accessible introduction to the fascinating world of soil science and a reliable reference for your professional bookshelf. </p> <p> The parent 13th edition of <i>The Nature and Properties of Soils</i> maintains the ecological approach to soil science education characteristic of the two previous editions. This approach helps you understand the many critical ecosystem processes that are centered in the soil and that form the basis of interactions between soils and other ecosystem components such as groundwater, air, streams, and vegetation. This <i>Elements</i> version preserves the ecological approach of its parent book, while telling the story of soil science in a more condensed form that some students and professors have found more suitable to their needs. </p> <p> Since 2000, when the first <i>Elements</i> edition was published, we have conferred with many students and professors who used the textbook. They told us that they need an updated coverage of soil science principles in approximately 550 pages, rather than the 960 pages of the parent textbook. They also urged that we not diminish either the scientific rigor or the easy readability of the parent book. We have tried to follow their advice. We have been able to limit <i>Elements</i> to about 60% of the number of pages in the parent book by rewriting and condensing many sections, by reorienting much of the artwork, and by reorganizing and reducing application details so as to allow the fundamentals of soil science to be covered in 15 rather than 20 chapters. </p> <p> New to this edition of <i>Elements</i> is expanded coverage of topics that are critically important to the future role of soils in natural resource sciences: wetlands, septic drain fields, salt-affected soils, bioremediation, soil ecology, nutrient and irrigation management, soil hydrology, and new concepts in <i>Soil Taxonomy.</i> This edition includes new sections on the pedosphere concept, nonsilicate colloids, inner and outer sphere complexes, effective CEC, proton balance approach to soil acidity, acid and non-acid cation saturation, human-influenced acidity, Ca and Mg in plants and soils, irrigation water quality, biomolecule binding, soil food web ecology, forest nutrient management, a phosphorus pollution site index, indicators of soil quality, and many other topics of current interest in soil science. In response to their popularity in the previous two editions, we have also added new "boxes" that present either engaging examples and applications or technical details and calculations. These boxes both <i>highlight</i> material of special interest and allow the logical thread of the regular text to flow smoothly without digression or interruption. In addition to updating many references, we have added a new feature to this edition, a set of World Wide Web links printed in the margins of the relevant chapter sections. </p> <p> We could not have done all this without the many valuable suggestions, ideas, and corrections sent to us by soil scientists, instructors, and students from around the world. This edition has once again greatly benefited from such contributions. The high level of professional devotion and camaraderie shared by so many students and practitioners of soil science never ceases to inspire us. We appreciate the comments and suggestions concerning the makeup of this abridged edition made by a number of students and professors who responded to inquiries from the field staff of Prentice Hall. We are especially grateful to Lyle Nelson, Professor Emeritus at Mississippi State University for reviewing the entire text and making excellent and constructive comments. Joyce Torio of the American Chemical Society provided very useful background information on the problems and opportunities affecting global soil quality. In addition, Karen Lowell Langholtz provided able research and editorial assistance for this edition. </p> <p> Special thanks go to the following colleagues who generously reviewed portions of the parent textbook in detail and made valuable suggestions for improvement: Duane Wolf (University of Arkansas); J. Kenneth Torrence (Carleton University); Jessica Davis (Colorado State University); Harold van Es and Martin Alexander (Cornell University); Dan Richter (Duke University); Michael Beug (Evergreen State University); Lee Burras (Iowa State University); Kudjo Dzantor, Delvin Fanning, Robert Hill, Bruce James, Martin Rabenhorst, and Patricia Steinhilber (University of Maryland); Daniel Hillel (University of Massachusetts); Lyle Nelson (Mississippi State University); Jimmie Richardson (North Dakota State University); Darrell Schultze (Purdue University); Murray Milford (Texas A &amp; M University); Rattan Lal (Ohio State University); Mike Swift (UN Tropical Biology Program); Allen Franzluebbers, Jeff Herrick, Scott Lesch, and Jim Rhoades (USDAAgricultural Research Service); Bob Ahrens, Hari Eswaran, Paul Reich, and Sharon Waltman (USDA/Natural Resources Conservation Service); Fred Magdoff and Wendy Sue Harper (University of Vermont); W. Lee Daniels, S. K. de Datta, and Lucian Zelazny (Virginia Tech.); Clay Robinson (West Texas A &amp; M University); and Tom Siccama (Yale University). </p> <p> Once again, we express our heartfelt thanks to our wives, Martha and Trish, for their encouragement, understanding, and patience without which we could not possibly have found the time and energy required to make such extensive improvements to this textbook. They bear witness to the fact that our effort to continuously improve <i>The Nature and Properties of Soils</i> textbooks is truly a labor of love. </p> <p> &#x2014; <i>N.C.B. and R.R.W.</i> </p></p><h2>Introductory Algebra: An Applied Approach</h2><p>As in previous editions, the focus in INTRODUCTORY ALGEBRA remains on the Aufmann Interactive Method (AIM). Students are encouraged to be active participants in the classroom and in their own studies as they work through the How To examples and the paired Examples and You Try It problems. Student engagement is crucial to success. Presenting students with worked examples, and then providing them with the opportunity to immediately solve similar problems, helps them build their confidence and eventually master the concepts. Simplicity is key in the organization of this edition, as in all other editions. All lessons, exercise sets, tests, and supplements are organized around a carefully constructed hierarchy of objectives. Each exercise mirrors a preceding objective, which helps to reinforce key concepts and promote skill building. This clear, objective-based approach allows students to organize their thoughts around the content, and supports instructors as they work to design syllabi, lesson plans, and other administrative documents. New features like Focus on Success, Apply the Concept, and Concept Check add an increased emphasis on study skills and conceptual understanding to strengthen the foundation of student success. The Ninth Edition also features a new design, enhancing the Aufmann Interactive Method and making the pages easier for both students and instructors to follow.

When F. G. Banting and J. J. R. Macleod won the 1923 Nobel Prize for discovering and isolating insulin, Banting immediately announced that he was dividing his share of the prize with his young associate, C. H. Best. Macleod divided his share with a fourth member of the team, J. B. Collip. For the next sixty years medical opinion was intensely divided over the allotment of credit for the discovery of insulin. In resolving this controversy, Bliss also offers a wealth of new detail on such subjects as the treatment of diabetes before insulin and the life-and-death struggle to manufacture insulin.</p><p><p><b>Michael Bliss</b> is University Professor Emeritus in the Department of History and the History of Medicine Program at the University of Toronto.</p><p>'The definitive history ... well written, highly readable.'</p> (London Review of Books)<br><br><p>"Scrupulously researched and compellingly readable ...

The authors are naturopathic doctors--they focus on promoting health and treating disease with nontoxic, natural therapies. Naturopathic medicine follows these seven principles: <ol><li>Do no harm: use safe, effective, natural therapies. </li><li>Nature has healing powers: the physician's job is to enhance the body's natural power to heal itself. </li><li>Identify and treat the cause: find the cause, rather than just suppress the symptoms. </li><li>Treat the whole person: administer to the patient's physical, mental/emotional, spiritual, and social sides. </li><li>The physician is a teacher: educate and motivate patients to take more responsibility for their health. </li><li>Prevention is the best cure: health-supporting life habits prevent disease. </li><li>Establish health and wellness: increase the patient's positive physical and mental state.</li></ol><p> This book shows you how to improve your health through a positive mental attitude, healthy lifestyle, health-promoting diet, and supplements, with plenty of practical tips. Learn disease prevention through enhancing key body systems. The bulk of the book details natural remedies for treating more than 70 ailments. Each includes symptoms, description, therapeutic considerations (with discussion of studies), and a treatment summary, including nutritional supplements and botanical (herbal) medicines. If you have a disease, this book will give you a valuable perspective on natural treatments. If you're well, it will give you many pointers for maintaining and enhancing your health. <i>--Joan Price</i></p>The perfect balance between the latest research and age-old wisdom</p><h2>What Your First Grader Needs to Know: Fundamentals of a Good First-Grade Education (Core Knowledge Series)</h2><p><b>Give your child a smart start with</b><br> <b><i>What Your First Grader Needs to Know</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> What will your child be expected to learn in the first grade?

Reforms that strive for educational excellence are likely to fail unless they are meaningfully linked to the school's unique culture. In Shaping School Culture, Terrence E. Deal and Kent D. Peterson show how leaders can harness the power of school culture to build a lively, cooperative spirit and a sense of school identity.<br> <br> The authors draw from over twenty years of research on school improvement as well as from their own extensive work with school leaders across the country to identify viable new strategies for effective school leadership. They describe the critical elements of culture--the purposes, traditions, norms, and values that guide and glue the community together--and show how a positive culture can make school reforms work. Deal and Peterson also explore the harmful characteristics of toxic cultures and suggest antidotes to negativity on the part of teachers, students, principals, or parents.<br> <br> Using real-life cases from their own research, Deal and Peterson provide concrete, detailed illustrations of exemplary practice in different school cultures. They reveal the key symbolic roles that leaders play in school change and identify the specific skills needed to change school culture successfully. Shaping School Culture provides an action blueprint for school leaders committed to transforming their schools for success.</p><p>"Nothing is more important about a school than its culture. No one occupies a more influential position from which to influence a school's culture than its principal. And no guidebook presents a better, more approachable path toward understanding and building a school culture than this one. I wish I had had <i>Shaping School Culture</i> beside me during my own turbulent years as a school principal." <br> &#x2014;<b>Roland S. Barth</b>, educator and author of Improving Schools from Within <p>"Every successful school leader knows that culture is everything! Deal and Peterson offer principals and other school leaders a genuinely useful guide to recognizing, nurturing, and reshaping the cultures of their schools. This practical book demonstrates the many cultural roles that school leaders play and provides clear, helpful examples of how effective leaders apply their knowledge of culture to improve their schools."<br> &#x2014;<b>Laraine Roberts</b>, director of research and development, California School Leadership Academy</p> <p>"Deal and Peterson marinate the reader in a wealth of stories, anecdotes, case studies, and strategies&#x2014; all of which vividly illustrate how school leaders can shape the culture of their schools in order to make an impact on student learning and achievement.

Kim paints seven vivid scenes from a boyhood and early adolescence in Korea at the height of the Japanese occupation during WWII, 1932 to 1945. Taking its title from the grim fact that the occupiers forced the Koreans to renounce their own names and adopt Japanese names instead, the book follows one Korean family through the Japanese occupation to the surrender of Japan and dissolution of the Japanese empire. Examining the intersections of Japanese and Korean history that influenced Korea-Japan relations at the time, <i>Lost Names</i> is at once a loving memory of family, an ethnography of Zainichi Koreans in 1930s Japan, and a vivid portrayal of human spirit in a time of suffering and survival.</p><p><b>Richard E.

Are there basic rules governing design that, when learned, will facilitate the creative process? These questions have been asked by artists, art historians, and art critics throughout the ages.<br>Convinced that design was not purely instinctive, Jay Hambidge (1867&#x2013;1924) spent much of his life searching for the technical bases of design. He found his answer in dynamic symmetry, one of the most provocative and stimulating theories in art history. Hambidge's study of Greek art convinced him that the secret of the beauty of Greek design was in the conscious use of dynamic symmetry &#x2014; the law of natural design based upon the symmetry of growth in man and in plants. But Hambidge, who was not only a theoretician but also a practicing artist, did much more than analyze classical art and its principles of design: he worked out a series of root rectangles that the artist, using the simple mathematics supplied in this book, can easily follow and apply in his own work.<br>Originally published as a series of lessons in Hambidge's magazine, <i>The Diagonal,</i> this engrossing book explains all the basic principles of dynamic symmetry. Part I sets forth the fundamental rectangles with their simple divisions based on the proportioning law found in nature; Part II explains compound rectangles, many of which were taken from or suggested by analysis of objects of Greek art. <br>Whether read for its historical importance in art theory, for its illuminating insights into Greek art, or for its practical value to today's artists and commercial designers, <i>The Elements of Dynamic Symmetry</i> has much to offer anyone who is interested in the principle of design.</p><p></p><h2>Catullus, Tibullus, Pervigilium Veneris (Loeb Classical Library No. 6)</h2><p><p>Catullus (Gaius Valerius, 84&#x2013;54 BCE), of Verona, went early to Rome, where he associated not only with other literary men from Cisalpine Gaul but also with Cicero and Hortensius. His surviving poems consist of nearly sixty short lyrics, eight longer poems in various metres, and almost fifty epigrams. All exemplify a strict technique of studied composition inherited from early Greek lyric and the poets of Alexandria. In his work we can trace his unhappy love for a woman he calls Lesbia; the death of his brother; his visits to Bithynia; and his emotional friendships and enmities at Rome. For consummate poetic artistry coupled with intensity of feeling Catullus's poems have no rival in Latin literature.</p><p>Tibullus (Albius, ca. 54&#x2013;19 BCE), of equestrian rank and a friend of Horace, enjoyed the patronage of Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, whom he several times apostrophizes. Three books of elegies have come down to us under his name, of which only the first two are authentic. Book 1 mostly proclaims his love for 'Delia', Book 2 his passion for 'Nemesis'. The third book consists of a miscellany of poems from the archives of Messalla; it is very doubtful whether any come from the pen of Tibullus himself. But a special interest attaches to a group of them which concern a girl called Sulpicia: some of the poems are written by her lover Cerinthus, while others purport to be her own composition.</p><p>The <i>Pervigilium Veneris</i>, a poem of not quite a hundred lines celebrating a spring festival in honour of the goddess of love, is remarkable both for its beauty and as the first clear note of romanticism which transformed classical into medieval literature. The manuscripts give no clue to its author, but recent scholarship has made a strong case for attributing it to the early fourth-century poet Tiberianus.</p></p><p>Catullus, of Verona, went early to Rome, where he associated not only with other literary men form Cisalpine Gaul but also with Cicero and Hortensius.

Cindy is a native Californian born in San Diego, but she has lived in many places, including Hawaii, Austria, and Germany. She currently&nbsp;lives in Pleasanton, California.Long ago, in a land known as Camelot, there lived many knights and ladies. Their ruler was a mighty, but gracious, man named King Arthur. During many years of peace and good harvests, the people lived happily.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trouble began when they saw the army of their neighbors to the north gathering at the border. These people, known as the Circumscribers, looked as if they might be preparing to make war. King Arthur called upon his bravest and most trusted knights to plan what to do.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The knights rode as fast as they could to the King&#x2019;s castle. Sir Cumference lived nearby, so his family came with him. Sir Cumference was married to Lady Di, who came from the town of Ameter.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had a son named Radius.

Soloveitchik, the rabbi known as &#x201c;The Rav&#x201d; by his followers worldwide, was a leading authority on the meaning of Jewish law and prominent force in building bridges between traditional Orthodox Judaism and the modern world. In <i>The Lonely Man of Faith</i>, a soaring, eloquent essay first published in <i>Tradition</i> magazine in 1965, Soloveitchik investigates the essential loneliness of the person of faith in our narcissistic, materially oriented, utilitarian society.<br><br>In this modern classic, Soloveitchik uses the story of Adam and Eve as a springboard, interweaving insights from such important Western philosophers as Kierkegaard and Kant with innovative readings of Genesis to provide guidance for the faithful in today&#x2019;s world. He explains prayer as &#x201c;the harbinger of moral reformation,&#x201d; and discusses with empathy and understanding the despair and exasperation of individuals who seek personal redemption through direct knowledge of a God who seems remote and unapproachable. He shows that while the faithful may become members of a religious community, their true home is &#x201c;the abode of loneliness.&#x201d; In a moving personal testimony, Soloveitchik demonstrates a deep-seated commitment, intellectual courage, and integrity to which people of all religions will respond.</p><p><b>JOSEPH B. SOLOVEITCHIK</b> was born in Russia in 1903 into a family of eminent Eastern European rabbis. In 1932 he became the chief rabbi of Boston, where he lived until his death in 1993. He founded the Maimonides School in Boston and for many years traveled to New York City to teach at Yeshiva University.I<br>THE NATURE OF the dilemma can be stated in a three-word sentence. I am lonely. Let me emphasize, however, that by stating "I am lonely" I do not intend to convey to you the impression that I am alone. I, thank God, do enjoy the love and friendship of many. I meet people, talk, preach, argue, reason; I am surrounded by comrades and acquaintances. And yet, companionship and friendship do not alleviate the passional experience of loneliness which trails me constantly. I am lonely because at times I feel rejected and thrust away by everybody, not excluding my most intimate friends, and the words of the Psalmist, "My father and my mother have forsaken me," ring quite often in my ears like the plaintive cooing of the turtledove. It is a strange, alas, absurd experience engendering sharp, enervating pain as well as a stimulating, cathartic feeling. I despair because I am lonely and, hence, feel frustrated. On the other hand, I also feel invigorated because this very experience of loneliness presses everything in me into the service of God. In my "desolate, howling solitude" I experience a growing awareness that, to paraphrase Plotinus's apothegm about prayer, this service to which I, a lonely and solitary individual, am committed is wanted and gracefully accepted by God in His transcendental loneliness and numinous solitude.<br><br>I must address myself to the obvious question: why am I beset by this feeling of loneliness and being unwanted? Is it the Kierkegaardian anguish--an ontological fear nurtured by the awareness of nonbeing threatening one's existence--that assails me, or is this feeling of loneliness solely due to my own personal stresses, cares, and frustrations? Or is it perhaps the result of the pervasive state of mind of Western man who has become estranged from himself, a state with which all of us as Westerners are acquainted?<br><br>I believe that even though all three explanations might be true to some extent, the genuine and central cause of the feeling of loneliness from which I cannot free myself is to be found in a different dimension, namely, in the experience of faith itself. I am lonely because, in my humble, inadequate way, I am a man of faith for whom to be means to believe, and who substituted "credo" for "cogito" in the time-honored Cartesian maxim.* Apparently, in this role, as a man of faith, I must experience a sense of loneliness which is of a compound nature. It is a blend of that which is inseparably interwoven into the very texture of the faith gesture, characterizing the unfluctuating metaphysical destiny of the man of faith, and of that which is extraneous to the act of believing and stems from the ever-changing human-historical situation with all its whimsicality. On the one hand, the man of faith has been a solitary figure throughout the ages, indeed millennia, and no one has succeeded in escaping this unalterable destiny which is an "objective" awareness rather than a subjective feeling. On the other hand, it is undeniably true that this basic awareness expresses itself in a variety of ways, utilizing the whole gamut of one's affective emotional life which is extremely responsive to outward challenges and moves along with the tide of cultural and historical change. Therefore, it is my intent to analyze this experience at both levels: at the ontological, at which it is a root awareness, and at the historical, at which a highly sensitized and agitated heart, overwhelmed by the impact of social and cultural forces, filters this root awareness through the medium of painful, frustrating emotions.<br><br>As a matter of fact, the investigation at the second level is my prime concern since I am mainly interested in contemporary man of faith who is, due to his peculiar position in our secular society, lonely in a special way. No matter how time-honored and time-hallowed the interpenetration of faith and loneliness is, and it certainly goes back to the dawn of the Judaic covenant, contemporary man of faith lives through a particularly difficult and agonizing crisis.<br><br>Let me spell out this passional experience of contemporary man of faith.<br><br>He looks upon himself as a stranger in modern society, which is technically minded, self-centered, and self-loving, almost in a sickly narcissistic fashion, scoring honor upon honor, piling up victory upon victory, reaching for the distant galaxies, and seeing in the here-and-now sensible world the only manifestation of being. What can a man of faith like myself, living by a doctrine which has no technical potential, by a law which cannot be tested in the laboratory, steadfast in his loyalty to an eschatological vision whose fulfillment cannot be predicted with any degree of probability, let alone certainty, even by the most complex, advanced mathematical calculations--what can such a man say to a functional, utilitarian society which is <i>saeculum</i>-oriented and whose practical reasons of the mind have long ago supplanted the sensitive reasons of the heart?<br><br>It would be worthwhile to add the following in order to place the dilemma in the proper focus. I have never been seriously troubled by the problem of the Biblical doctrine of creation vis-a-vis the scientific story of evolution at both the cosmic and the organic levels, nor have I been perturbed by the confrontation of the mechanistic interpretation of the human mind with the Biblical spiritual concept of man. I have not been perplexed by the impossibility of fitting the mystery of revelation into the framework of historical empiricism. Moreover, I have not even been troubled by the theories of Biblical criticism which contradict the very foundations upon which the sanctity and integrity of the Scriptures rest. However, while theoretical oppositions and dichotomies have never tormented my thoughts, I could not shake off the disquieting feeling that the practical role of the man of faith within modern society is a very difficult, indeed, a paradoxical one.<br><br>The purpose of this essay, then, is to define the great dilemma confronting contemporary man of faith. Of course, as I already remarked, by defining the dilemma we do not expect to find its solution, for the dilemma is insoluble. However, the defining itself is a worthwhile cognitive gesture which, I hope, will yield a better understanding of ourselves and our commitment. Knowledge in general and self-knowledge in particular are gained not only from discovering logical answers but also from formulating logical, even though unanswerable, questions. The human logos is as concerned with an honest inquiry into an insoluble antinomy which leads to intellectual despair and humility as it is with an unprejudiced true solution of a complex problem arousing joy and enhancing one's intellectual determination and boldness.<br><br>Before beginning the analysis, we must determine within which frame of reference, psychological and empirical or theological and Biblical, our dilemma should be described. I believe you will agree with me that we do not have much choice in the matter; for, to the man of faith, self-knowledge has one connotation only--to understand one's place and role within the scheme of events and things willed and approved by God, when He ordered finitude to emerge out of infinity and the Universe, including man, to unfold itself. This kind of self-knowledge may not always be pleasant or comforting. On the contrary, it might from time to time express itself in a painful appraisal of the difficulties which man of faith, caught in his paradoxical destiny, has to encounter, for knowledge at both planes, the scientific and the personal, is not always a eudaemonic experience. However, this unpleasant prospect should not deter us from our undertaking.<br><br>Before I go any further, I want to make the following reservation. Whatever I am about to say is to be seen only as a modest attempt on the part of a man of faith to interpret his spiritual perceptions and emotions in modern theological and philosophical categories. My interpretive gesture is completely subjective and lays no claim to representing a definitive Halakhic philosophy. If my audience will feel that these interpretations are also relevant to their perceptions and emotions, I shall feel amply rewarded. However, I shall not feel hurt if my thoughts will find no response in the hearts of my listeners.<br>We all know that the Bible offers two accounts of the creation of man. We are also aware of the theory suggested by Bible critics attributing these two accounts to two different traditions and sources. Of course, since we do unreservedly accept the unity and integrity of the Scriptures and their divine character, we reject this hypothesis which is based, like much Biblical criticism, on literary categories invented by modern man, ignoring completely the eidetic-noetic content of the Biblical story. It is, of course, true that the two accounts of the creation of man differ considerably. This incongruity was not discovered by the Bible critics. Our sages of old were aware of it.* However, the answer lies not in an alleged dual tradition but in dual man, not in an imaginary contradiction between two versions but in a real contradiction in the nature of man. The two accounts deal with two Adams, two men, two fathers of mankind, two types, two representatives of humanity, and it is no wonder that they are not identical. Let us just read these two accounts.<br><br>In Genesis 1 we read: "So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him, male and female created He them. And God blessed them and God said unto them, be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the fowl of the heaven, and over the beasts, and all over the earth."<br><br>In Genesis 2, the account differs substantially from the one we just read: "And the eternal God formed the man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul. And the eternal God planted a garden eastward in Eden. . . . And the eternal God took the man and placed him in the Garden of Eden to serve it and to keep it."<br><br>I want to point out four major discrepancies between these two accounts:<br>1. In the story of the creation of Adam the first, it is told that the latter was created in the image of God, PKTM�A PMSL, while nothing is said about how his body was formed. In the account of the creation of Adam the second, it is stated that he was fashioned from the dust of the ground and God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.<br><br>2. Adam the first received the mandate from the Almighty to fill the earth and subdue it, FAMN EVLLF sDAE WA. Adam the second was charged with the duty to cultivate the garden and to keep it, EDJVMF EDLQM.<br><br>3. In the story of Adam the first, both male and female were created concurrently, while Adam the second emerged alone, with Eve appearing subsequently as his helpmate and complement.<br><br>4. Finally, and this is a discrepancy of which Biblical criticism has made so much, while in the first account only the name of E-lohim appears, in the second, E-lohim is used in conjunction with the Tetragrammaton.<br>Let us portray these two men. Adam the first and Adam the second, in typological categories.<br><br>There is no doubt that the term "image of God" in the first account refers to man's inner charismatic endowment as a creative being. Man's likeness to God expresses itself in man's striving and ability to become a creator. Adam the first who was fashioned in the image of God was blessed with great drive for creative activity and immeasurable resources for the realization of this goal, the most outstanding of which is the intelligence, the human mind, capable of confronting the outside world and inquiring into its complex workings.* In spite of the boundless divine generosity providing man with many intellectual capacities and interpretive perspectives in his approach to reality, God, in imparting the blessing to Adam the first and giving him the mandate to subdue nature, directed Adam's attention to the functional and practical aspects of his intellect through which man is able to gain control of nature. Other intellectual inquiries, such as the metaphysical or axiologico-qualitative, no matter how incisive and penetrating, have never granted man dominion over his environment. The Greeks, who excelled in philosophical noesis, were less skillful in technological achievements. Modern science has emerged victorious from its encounter with nature because it has sacrificed qualitative-metaphysical speculation for the sake of a functional duplication of reality and substituted the <i>quantus</i> for the <i>qualis</i> question. Therefore, Adam the first is interested in just a single aspect of reality and asks one question only--"How does the cosmos function?" He is not fascinated by the question, "Why does the cosmos function at all?" nor is he interested in the question, "What is its essence?" He is only curious to know how it works. In fact, even this "how" question with which Adam the first is preoccupied is limited in scope. He is concerned not with the question <i>per se</i>, but with its practical implications. He raises not a metaphysical but a practical, technical "how" question. To be precise, his question is related not to the genuine functioning of the cosmos in itself but to the possibility of reproducing the dynamics of the cosmos by employing quantified-mathematized media which man evolves through postulation and creative thinking. The conative movement of attraction which Adam the first experiences toward the world is not of an exploratory-cognitive nature. It is rather nurtured by the selfish desire on the part of Adam to better his own position in relation to his environment. Adam the first is overwhelmed by one quest, namely, to harness and dominate the elemental natural forces and to put them at his disposal. This practical interest arouses his will to learn the secrets of nature. He is completely utilitarian as far as motivation, teleology, design, and methodology are concerned.<br>What is Adam the first out to achieve? What is the objective toward which he incessantly drives himself with enormous speed? The objective, it is self-evident, can be only one, namely, that which God put up before him: to be "man," to be himself. Adam the first wants to be human, to discover his identity which is bound up with his humanity. How does Adam find himself? He works with a simple equation introduced by the Psalmist, who proclaimed the singularity and unique station of man in nature: "For thou made him a little lower than the angels and hast crowned him with glory and honor (dignity)."* Man is an honorable being. In other words, man is a dignified being and to be human means to live with dignity. However, this equation of two unknown qualities requires further elaboration. We must be ready to answer the question: What is dignity and how can it be realized? The answer we find again in the words of the Psalmist, who addressed himself to this obvious question and who termed man not only an honorable but also a glorious being, spelling out the essence of glory in unmistakable terms: "Thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands. Thou hast put all things under his feet." In other words, dignity was equated by the Psalmist with man's capability of dominating his environment and exercising control over it. Man acquires dignity through glory, through his <i>majestic </i>posture vis-a-vis his environment.*</p><h2>Your Guide to Cemetery Research</h2><p>Provides information on cemetery research covering such topics as locating graves and cemeteries, accessing death records, searching a cemetery, and American burial customs.</p><p>Sharon DeBartolo Carmack is a Certified Genealogist and the editor of Betterway genealogy books. She is the author of several books including A Genealogist's Guide to Discovering Your Immigrant &amp; Ethnic Ancestors, A Genealogist's Guide to Discovering Your Female Ancestors, and Organizing Your Family History Search.Slogging through graveyards armed with a camera and notepad may sound morbid, but it is high adventure to most genealogists. Indeed, according to Carmack (Organizing Your Family History Search), cemetery research provides valuable information about the dearly departed, and it can actually become a family tradition. Carmack begins her demystification of the process with a discussion of the various records created at the time of death (death certificates, funeral home records, and more) and the task of locating an ancestor's grave or cemetery. Once a burial site is established, a visit to the cemetery is in order. Carmack details the different kinds of cemeteries, grave decorations, and veterans' markers and explains the benefits of analyzing a cemetery's "community." A very helpful chapter on capturing a tombstone's information follows. Carmack covers American burial customs and the value (and pitfalls) of cemetery transcription and preservation projects. Finally, she offers ways to make cemetery visits a family affair. Examples of the artwork, epitaphs, and poetry found on tombstones are provided, as are an appendix of symbols and their meanings, a historical time line of America's epidemics and disasters, and a medical glossary. Genealogists and local historians of all stripes will find this book invaluable. Highly recommended for public and genealogy libraries. Elaine M. Kuhn, Allen Cty. P.L., Ft.

In a revised edition of <i>Furta Sacra</i>, Patrick Geary considers the social and cultural context for these acts, asking how the relics were perceived and why the thefts met with the approval of medieval Christians.</p></p><p>Saints are special kinds of heroes. They are of little interest as everyday people; their real significance lies in the way they exemplify universal values given by God. In <i>Furta Sacra: Thefts of Relics in the Central Middle Ages</i>, Patrick J. Geary devotes microscopic attention to the way medieval Christians and merchants raided tombs, plundered churches, and scoured the Roman catacombs in order to obtain sacred relics. Although Geary rejects the notion that cults of saints were "pure manifestations of religious devotions" devoid of cultural associations, he honors the religious impulses of some truly outrageous behavior. Geary's study is academic and a bit of a brain stretcher, but it's fairly short and worth close attention. In describing how hagiography mirrored the values of medieval society, he provides a helpful road map for alert readers interested in contemporary cults of saints. When Evangelicals honor C.S. Lewis, for instance, or South American Christians remember Eva Peron, or even when movie memorabilia collectors pay big bucks for Dorothy's ruby slippers, they relive a very old dream of bringing humanity's highest ideals down into earthly form. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><b>Patrick J.

But his work also shows that street style is not only about fashion; it&#x2019;s about the people and the changing culture.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>These photographs&#x2014;many never before seen, others having originally appeared in&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>&nbsp;and elsewhere&#x2014;move from decade to decade, beginning in the 1970s and continuing until Cunningham&#x2019;s death in 2016. Here you&#x2019;ll find Cunningham&#x2019;s distinctive chronicling of the 1980s transit strike, the rise of 1990s casual Fridays, the sadness that fell over the city following 9/11, Inauguration Day 2009, the onset of selfies, and many other significant moments.<br>&nbsp;<br>This enduring portfolio is enriched by essays that provide a revealing portrait of Cunningham and a few of his many fascinations and influences, contributed by Cathy Horyn, Tiina Loite, Vanessa Friedman, Ruth La Ferla, Guy Trebay, Penelope Green, Jacob Bernstein, and a much favored subject, Anna Wintour. More than anything,&nbsp;<i>On the Street</i>&nbsp;is a timeless representation of Cunningham&#x2019;s commitment to capturing the here and now.<br><br><b>&#x201c;An absolute delight.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>People</i></b></p><p><b>Bill Cunningham&nbsp;</b>was an American fashion icon and photographer for&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>from 1978 to 2016, known for his candid and street photography. Before capturing the&nbsp;<i>Times</i>&#x2019;s attention with a candid of Greta Garbo, Bill was a designer of women&#x2019;s hats, then a fashion writer for&nbsp;<i>Women&#x2019;s Wear Daily&nbsp;</i>and the&nbsp;<i>Chicago Tribune</i>.PREFACE<br><br>by&nbsp;TIINA LOITE, former photography editor, <i>The New York Times</i> Styles section<br><br> Bill Cunningham was a photographer, yet he&nbsp;always liked to insist he wasn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a&nbsp;real photographer,&#x201d; he would say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a columnist&nbsp;who writes with pictures.&#x201d;<br><br> I knew and worked with Bill for more than&nbsp;thirty years as a photo editor at <i>The New York&nbsp;Times</i>. When I was asked to select and organize his work for this book, I did not kid myself about&nbsp;what that would involve. Bill worked seemingly&nbsp;around the clock, virtually every day of the year. My rough guess was that the number of photographs&nbsp;to research would equal the number on the national debt clock. As it turned out, I was&nbsp;pretty close.<br><br> I began in familiar territory, with the tens of&nbsp;thousands of pictures Bill took for <i>The Times,&nbsp;</i>starting in the 1970s. This process was painstaking, months-long, and made more difficult by the&nbsp;paper&#x2019;s database, which the years, moves, and human foibles had left incomplete. But to gain a&nbsp;full understanding of Bill&#x2019;s range, it was important&nbsp;to look carefully at as many of the photos as&nbsp;were accessible, both those that had been published&nbsp;and those that had not.<br><br> And then there was Bill&#x2019;s own personal archive,&nbsp;which is the fashion world&#x2019;s equivalent of King Tut&#x2019;s tomb. He kept this massive trove in his apartment, and after he died, it was transferred under the care of his niece, Trish Simonson, to an art-storage facility in Rockland County, just north of New York City. There, file cabinets and&nbsp;boxes&#x2014;so numerous that forklifts are required to transfer them to a hangarlike room for viewing&#x2014;overflow with prints, negatives, contact sheets,&nbsp;correspondence, clippings, notebooks, and more. Some drawers are so packed with files that they are nearly impenetrable.<br><br> What struck me most while searching through this remarkable material was that Bill was a man who absolutely loved his job. Was it even really a job? I think it was just Bill. More important, he understood the relevance of his work. The folders containing his negatives are also packed with layouts and absolutely every other piece of paper&nbsp;pertaining to that week&#x2019;s column. When I looked at shots of blizzards from the 1970s, for example, he had noted how many inches of snow had fallen and how fast the wind was blowing. When I looked at the shots from a luncheon, even the printed menu and Bill&#x2019;s phone message slips remained. All this&nbsp;supplemental material seemed to be more than notes to himself. I felt like it was there to benefit those who might look through this collection in the future, as I was now. Bill knew; Bill always knew.<br><br> He was famous for not spending much money on cameras&#x2014;or bicycles, or clothing, or even file folders. Many of the &#x201c;folders&#x201d; in his cabinets were simply large envelopes that colleagues had discarded. When<i> The Times </i>went digital and eliminated its photo lab, Bill continued to use film, taking it to a one-hour developer. He was encouraged to consider digital cameras, with colleagues even bringing technicians to the office to tutor him, but he would always mysteriously disappear when they arrived. Eventually, though, when the number of one-hour labs around the city dwindled, he finally surrendered.<br><br> So how to go about choosing what is to appear in this book? First, I had to accept that many wonderful images would be omitted&#x2014;many of these images were missing and still I could have filled thousand-page volumes with what was available. Second, I knew that no matter what, some people would be upset by what is left out. Third, I tried to not have Bill be one of them.<br><br> His signature in his On the Street column in <i>The Times </i>was a large number of small photographs illustrating a particular theme, which varied from issue to issue. He focused on the ensemble, or on a specific part of it, a hat perhaps, or a shoe. Bill also photographed things around the city to accent or accessorize his layouts&#x2014;yellow daffodils to run alongside a layout of yellow clothing, for example. To him, the more pictures, the more densely packed the page, the better. He loved cropping, as seen at left, and shoehorning as many photos as he could into those layouts. It brought a look of mischievous glee to his face, even as he would then say, &#x201c;This is all just filler around the ads, kids.&#x201d;<br><br> But in looking at the totality of his photographs&nbsp;(or at least something relatively close to it), I found&nbsp;so many images that were wonderful just as they&nbsp;were, no cropping needed. The approach for this&nbsp;book was to let his photographs be photographs,&nbsp;so we see the trees for the forest. While photos of&nbsp;similar styles are still grouped together&#x2014;reminiscent&nbsp;of the column&#x2014;the reader can see how the&nbsp;images play off of one another, how they play off of images on the facing page. Many pages have&nbsp;only one photo on them (OK, Bill&#x2019;s probably not&nbsp;happy). This book is not a collection of Bill&#x2019;s&nbsp;columns. It is a collection of his photographs.<br><br> Because Bill Cunningham was a real photographer.</p><h2>Loose Leaf Fundamentals of Corporate Finance</h2><p>Brealey, <i>Fundamentals of Corporate Finance</i>, 10e, is an introduction to corporate finance and focuses on how companies invest in real assets, how they raise the money to pay for the investments, and how those assets ultimately affect the value of the firm.

According to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a judge like this can maneuver through earlier cases to achieve the desired aim--"distinguishing one prior case on his left, straight-arming another one on his right, high-stepping away from another precedent about to tackle him from the rear, until (bravo!) he reaches the goal--good law." But is this common-law mindset, which is appropriate in its place, suitable also in statutory and constitutional interpretation? In a witty and trenchant essay, Justice Scalia answers this question with a resounding negative.</p><br><p> In exploring the neglected art of statutory interpretation, Scalia urges that judges resist the temptation to use legislative intention and legislative history. In his view, it is incompatible with democratic government to allow the meaning of a statute to be determined by what the judges think the lawgivers meant rather than by what the legislature actually promulgated. Eschewing the judicial lawmaking that is the essence of common law, judges should interpret statutes and regulations by focusing on the text itself. Scalia then extends this principle to constitutional law. He proposes that we abandon the notion of an everchanging Constitution and pay attention to the Constitution's original meaning. Although not subscribing to the "strict constructionism" that would prevent applying the Constitution to modern circumstances, Scalia emphatically rejects the idea that judges can properly "smuggle" in new rights or deny old rights by using the Due Process Clause, for instance. In fact, such judicial discretion might lead to the destruction of the Bill of Rights if a majority of the judges ever wished to reach that most undesirable of goals.</p><br><p> This essay is followed by four commentaries by Professors Gordon Wood, Laurence Tribe, Mary Ann Glendon, and Ronald Dworkin, who engage Justice Scalia's ideas about judicial interpretation from varying standpoints. In the spirit of debate, Justice Scalia responds to these critics.</p></p><p><b>Antonin Scalia (1936&#x2013;2016)</b> was an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court for three decades."[We] are lucky to have, in book form, an essay on legal interpretation by Justice Scalia....[He] projects a sanguine humor through a robust prose enlivened by sly sallies against what he sees as the gaps in logic of the opposing camp. He is anything but the angry justice of popular myth."<b>---John O. McGinnis, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>"<i>A Matter of Interpretation</i> demonstrates both the attraction of Scalia's 'textualist' theory and his qualities as a judicial statesman. . . [His] elegant essay, the most concise and accessible presentation of his views, argues eloquently that judicial authority can only be based on the statutory or constitutional text."<b>---Michael Greve, <i>Reason</i></b><br><br>"As the most intellectually consistent and stylistically gifted member of the Supreme Court, Scalia has never hidden his enthusiasm for the American tradition of mistrusting courts and lawyers. The basics of his judicial philosophy are now usefully collated into this volume. . . . Scalia's arguments have shaped the debate in our time; he has gone a long way toward changing how judges interpret the letter of the law."<b>---David Franklin, <i>Slate</i></b><br><br>"[T]he Supreme Court's highest-profile conservative . . . Suggest[s] we ought to junk judicial review as we have known it. . . . The reason, I think, is that Scalia objects not merely to certain decisions of this or prior Courts but to judicial review, American-style, in its entirety. His central aim as a jurist has been to get the federal courts out of the business of adjudicating individual rights."<b>---Garrett Epps, <i>The Nation</i></b><br><br>"[Scalia] is formidably persuasive, by turns seductive, fierce, funny, charming--and always brilliant."<b>---Paul Reidinger, <i>American Bar Association Journal</i></b><br><br>"Love him or hate him (it's hard to imagine a neutral opinion), Scalia is a brilliant and engaging writer.

Don&#x2019;t wait until a decision is forced on you or made for you. Seek out decisions that advance your long-term goals, values, and beliefs. Take charge of your life by making <i>Smart Choices</i> a lifetime habit.</p><p>Have you ever hired someone only to regret your decision two months later? Or looked at your financial portfolio and wondered why you bought the stocks you did? In <i>Smart Choices</i>, authors John S. Hammond, Ralph L. Keeney, and Howard Raiffa take the guesswork out of the decision-making process and offer a systematic approach to making the right choice. Most of us have problems making decisions, because we've never learned how. The authors write: <blockquote> Despite the importance of decision making to our lives, few of us ever receive any training in it. So we are left to learn from experience. But experience is a costly, inefficient teacher that teaches us bad habits along with good ones. Because decision situations vary so markedly, the experience of making one important decision often seems of little use when facing the next. </blockquote> <i>Smart Choices</i> outlines eight elements involved in making the right decision, from identifying exactly what the decision is and specifying your objectives to considering risk tolerance and looking at how what you decide on today influences what you may decide in the future. The book is full of real-life situations and scenarios that effectively illustrate each element of a good decision. If you think the topic of making the right choice is mundane or a simple matter of common sense, then think again. <i>Smart Choices</i> will relieve you of the regret that so many of us carry because we didn't know how to "think it through." <i>--Harry C. Edwards</i>Where should I live? Which house should I buy?<br> * Is it time to change careers-or go back to graduate school?<br> * What mutual fund should I select to meet my financial goals?<br> * Which job candidate should I hire?<br> Making smart choices is a fundamental life skill, relevant to everyone: businesspeople, doctors, lawyers, teachers, students, parents, young, old. Your decisions shape the course of your professional career and the quality of your personal life. Yet few people learn real decision-making skills. Consequently we approach our choices tentatively, or even fearfully, and avoid giving decisions the time and thought required to turn them to our best advantage. Smart Choices offers the first straightforward, easy-to-follow process designed to improve the way you make business decisions, family decisions, personal decisions-any decision that can help you reach your goals.<p> Authors Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa, among the world's best-known experts on resolving complex decision problems, have created a user-friendly set of techniques for assessing your options more clearly and effectively, ultimately empowering you to make smarter choices. Their step-by-step procedures combine solid research with practical experience and common sense to help you specify your objectives, identify creative alternatives, make reasoned tradeoffs, clarify uncertainties, and evaluate the risks. Smart Choices doesn't tell you what to decide; it tells you how. As you routinely use the Smart Choices process, you'll become more confident in your ability to make good decisions and to explain them to others. More important, you'll make better decisions. Be proactive. Don't wait until a decision is forced on you-or made for you. Seek out decision opportunities that advance your long-range goals, values, and core beliefs. Take charge of your life by making Smart Choices a lifetime habit.</p></p><h2>Savoir Dire: Cours de Phon�tique et de Prononciation (French Edition)</h2><p>Aimed at advanced students of French without an extensive background in linguistics, Savoir dire clearly and accessibly explains all major features of standard French pronunciation.

She herself rejected an emphasis on the pioneering aspects of her career, saying that &#x201c;it&#x2019;s almost like it&#x2019;s an honor rather than a disgrace&#x201d; and that she should &#x201c;be the fiftieth and the thousandth by this point&#x201d;&#x2014;a remark that suggests the complexity and singularity of vision to be found in her plays. Childress worked as an actress before turning to playwriting in 1949, and she was a political activist all of her life.&nbsp;<br><br>Spanning the 1940s to the 1960s, the plays collected here are the ones Childress herself believed were her best, and offer a realistic portrait of the racial inequalities and social injustices that characterized these decades. Her plays often feature strong-willed female protagonists whose problems bring into harsh relief the restrictions faced by African American women. This is the first volume devoted exclusively to the work of a major playwright whose impact on the American theater was profound and lasting.</p><p>Alice Childress (1916&#x2014;1994) was a playwright, novelist, and actress. Among her best-known plays are Trouble in Mind (1955), Wedding Band (1966), and Wine in the Wilderness (1969). She was the first African American woman to have a play professionally produced in New York City and the first woman to win an Obie Award for Best Play. She is also the author of A Hero Ain&#x2019;t Nothin&#x2019; But a Sandwich, a young-adult novel that was also made into a film. <br><br>Kathy A.

Nowhere has the pressure of human imagination been brought more powerfully to bear on our mortal condition than in his great narratives and narrative fragments, his sonnets of discovery, and his six magnificent odes, culminating in &#39;To Autumn.&#39;John Keats was born in October 1795, son of the manager of a livery stable in Moorfields. His father died in 1804 and his mother, of tuberculosis, in 1810. By then he had received a good education at John Clarke&#x2019;s Enfield private school. In 1811 he was apprenticed to a surgeon, completing his professional training at Guy&#x2019;s Hospital in 1816. His decision to commit himself to poetry rather than a medical career was a courageous one, based more on a challenge to himself than any actual achievement.His genius was recognized and encouraged by early Mends like Charles Cowden Clarke and J. H. Reynolds, and in October 1816 he met Leigh Hunt, whose Examiner had already published Keats&#x2019;s first poem. Only seven months later <i>Poems</i> (1817) appeared. Despite the high hopes of the Hunt circle, it was a failure. By the time Endymion was published in 1818 Keats&#x2019;s name had been identified with Hunt&#x2019;s "Cockney School," and the Tory&nbsp;Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine&nbsp;delivered a violent attack on Keats as a lower-class vulgarian, with no right to aspire to &#x2018;poetry&#x2019;.<br><br>But for Keats fame lay not in contemporary literary politics but with posterity. Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, and Wordsworth were his inspiration and challenge. The extraordinary speed with which Keats matured is evident from his letters. In 1818 he had worked on the powerful epic fragment Hyperion, and in 1819 he wrote <i>The Eve of St Agnes</i>, <i>La Belle Dame sans Merci</i>, <i>The Major Odes</i>, <i>Lamia</i>, and the deeply exploratory <i>Fall of Hyperion</i>. Keats was already unwell when preparing the 1820 volume for the press; by the time it appeared in July he was desperately ill. He died in Rome in 1821. Keats&#x2019;s final volume did receive some contemporary critical recognition, but it was not until the latter part of the nineteenth century that his place in English Romanticism began to be recognized, and not until this century that it became fully recognized.</p><h2>Fourteen Families in Pueblo Pottery</h2><p><p>In 1974 <i>Seven Families in Pueblo Pottery</i> was published to accompany an exhibit at the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology: twenty years later there are some 80,000 copies in print. Like <i>Seven Families</i>, this updated and greatly enlarged version by Rick Dillingham, who curated the original exhibition, includes portraits of the potters, color photographs of their work, and a statement by each potter about the work of his or her family. In addition to the original seven--the Chino and Lewis families (Acoma Pueblo), the Nampeyos (Hopi), the Guteirrez and Tafoya families (Santa Clara), and the Gonzales and Martinez families (San Ildefonso)--the author had added the Chapellas and the Navasies (Hopi-Tewa), the Chavarrias (Santa Clara), the Herrera family (Choti), the Medina family (Zia), and the Tenorio-Pacheco and the Melchor families (Santo Domingo). </p> <p>Because the craft of pottery is handed down from generation to generation among the Pueblo Indians, this extended look at multiple generations provides a fascinating and personal glimpse into how the craft has developed. Also evident are the differences of opinion among the artists about the future of Pueblo pottery and the importance of following tradition.</p> <p>A new generation of potters has come of age since the publication of <i>Seven Families</i>. The addition of their talents, along with an ever-growing interest in Native American pottery, make this book a welcome addition to the literature on the Southwest.</p></p><p>This beautiful book illustrates the many Pueblo pottery designs being created today and the traditions that have shaped them.Rick Dillingham (1952-1994) was a distinguished ceramicist and collector of pottery.

Yet Swift also wrote many other influential works, was a major political and religious figure in his time, and became a national hero, beloved for his fierce protest against English exploitation of his native Ireland. What is really known today about the enigmatic man behind these accomplishments? Can the facts of his life be separated from the fictions?<br><br> In this deeply researched biography, Leo Damrosch draws on discoveries made over the past thirty years to tell the story of Swift&#x2019;s life anew. Probing holes in the existing evidence, he takes seriously some daring speculations about Swift&#x2019;s parentage, love life, and various personal relationships and shows how Swift&#x2019;s public version of his life&#x2014;the one accepted until recently&#x2014;was deliberately misleading. Swift concealed aspects of himself and his relationships, and other people in his life helped to keep his secrets.<br><br> Assembling suggestive clues, Damrosch re-narrates the events of Swift&#x2019;s life while making vivid the sights, sounds, and smells of his English and Irish surroundings.Through his own words and those of a wide circle of friends, a complex Swift emerges: a restless, combative, empathetic figure, a man of biting wit and powerful mind, and a major figure in the history of world letters.</p><p><b>Leo Damrosch</b> is Ernest Bernbaum Research Professor of Literature at Harvard University.

Now, in <i>The View From The Studio Door</i>, Orland turns his attention to broader issues that stand to either side of that artistic moment of truth.<br> In a text marked by grace, brevity and humor, Orland argues that when it comes to art making, theory and practice are always intertwined. There are timeless philosophical questions (<i>How do we make sense of the world?</i>) that address the very nature of art making, as well as gritty real-world questions (<i>Is there art after graduation?</i>) that artists encounter the moment they're off the starting blocks and producing work on a regular basis.<br> Simply put, this is a book of practical philosophy. As a teacher and working artist himself, Orland brings authentic insight and encouragement to all those who face the challenge of making art in an uncertain world. The breadth of material covered is reflected in chapters that include Making Sense of the World, Art &amp; Society, The Education of the Artist, Surviving Graduation, Making Art That Matters, The Artistic Community, and more.

And a huge percentage of it is inaccurate. Some of the bad info is well-meaning but ignorant. Some of it is deliberately deceptive. All of it is pernicious.<br> <br> With the internet always at our fingertips, what&#x2019;s a teacher of history to do? Sam Wineburg has answers, beginning with this: We definitely can&#x2019;t stick to the same old read-the-chapter-answer-the-questions-at-the-back snoozefest we&#x2019;ve subjected students to for decades. If we want to educate citizens who can sift through the mass of information around them and separate fact from fake, we have to explicitly work to give them the necessary critical thinking tools. Historical thinking, Wineburg shows us in <i>Why Learn History (When It&#x2019;s Already on Your Phone)</i>, has nothing to do with test prep&#x2013;style ability to memorize facts. Instead, it&#x2019;s an orientation to the world that we can cultivate, one that encourages reasoned skepticism, discourages haste, and counters our tendency to confirm our biases. Wineburg draws on surprising discoveries from an array of research and experiments&#x2014;including surveys of students, recent attempts to update history curricula, and analyses of how historians, students, and even fact checkers approach online sources&#x2014;to paint a picture of a dangerously mine-filled landscape, but one that, with care, attention, and awareness, we can all learn to navigate.<br> <br> It&#x2019;s easy to look around at the public consequences of historical ignorance and despair. Wineburg is here to tell us it doesn&#x2019;t have to be that way. The future of the past may rest on our screens. But its fate rests in our hands.</p></p><p><b>Sam Wineburg</b> is the Margaret Jacks Professor of Education and History at Stanford University and the author of <i>Historical Thinking and Other Unnatural Acts</i>.<br>"To grasp how children think about and use the internet as they struggle to understand history, you must know how children think.

Mitchell views psychoanalysis as a fluid process in which the developing relationship between analyst and analysand--specifically in the gradual expression and shaping of their own desires and fears--becomes the field on which deep change is facilitated. Setting his observations in a theoretical context, he cites the work of such modern psychoanalytic thinkers as David Winnicut, Heinz Kohut, Melanie Klein and Daniel Stern, among others. He argues that "analytic method is not archaeological and reconstructive; it does not simply expose what is there. Rather it is constructive and synthetic; it organizes whatever is there into patterns it itself supplies." Exploring current theories of self along with such clinical issues as the beginnings and endings of analytic treatment, Mitchell writes with clarity and passion.

In a thought-provoking return to the original Hebrew conception of God, which questions accepted conceptions of divine omnipotence, Jon Levenson defines God's authorship of the world as a consequence of his victory in his struggle with evil. He traces a flexible conception of God to the earliest Hebrew sources, arguing, for example, that Genesis 1 does not describe the banishment of evil but the attempt to contain the menace of evil in the world, a struggle that continues today.</p></p><p>This paperback edition of Creation and the Persistence of Evil brings to a wide audience one of the most innovative and meaningful models of God for this post-Auschwitz era.<b>Jon D.

The traditional view, which presents Islam as a self-consciously distinct religion tied to the life and revelations of the prophet Muhammad in western Arabia, has since the 1970s been challenged by historians engaged in critical study of the Muslim sources. </p><p>In <i>Muhammad and the Believers</i>, the eminent historian Fred Donner offers a lucid and original vision of how Islam first evolved. He argues that the origins of Islam lie in what we may call the "Believers' movement" begun by the prophet Muhammad&#x2015;a movement of religious reform emphasizing strict monotheism and righteous behavior in conformity with God's revealed law. The Believers' movement thus included righteous Christians and Jews in its early years, because like the Qur'anic Believers, Christians and Jews were monotheists and agreed to live righteously in obedience to their revealed law. The conviction that Muslims constituted a separate religious community, utterly distinct from Christians and Jews, emerged a century later, when the leaders of the Believers' movement decided that only those who saw the Qur'an as the final revelation of the One God and Muhammad as the final prophet, qualified as Believers. This separated them decisively from monotheists who adhered to the Gospels or Torah.</p></p><p>Fred M. Donner is Professor of Near Eastern History in the Oriental Institute and Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago.&#x201c;Donner is one of the leading scholars of early Islam in the world. No other book I know of distills the often highly arcane and dispersed stuff of scholarship on the first century of Islamic history into such an accessible narrative account that, in addition, offers a compelling new interpretation on the formation of Islamic confessional identity. A tremendous achievement.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ahmet Karamustafa, Washington University in St. Louis</b><br><br>&#x201c;This is an invaluable book. Not only does it provide a sane and lucid guide to the origins of Islam, a topic that is currently more mired in controversy than any other in the entire field of ancient history, but it is also a stimulating and original work of scholarship in its own right.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Tom Holland, author of <i>Millennium</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Donner presents the intriguing view that the early Islamic movement, as presided over by Muhammad, actively included Jews and Christians in the flock as part of a general monotheistic community. It was only later, after Muhammad's death, that a new generation of Muslims began ritualizing Islam with its own distinctive practices, such as the hajj (pilgrimage) and the five daily prayers...He raises many original points, gleaning evidence from everything from coinage to original source documents. Questioning longstanding stereotypes, he argues (and proves) that Muslims are not, by nature, anti-Jewish and also that, based on archeological evidence, Muslims did not routinely tear down churches. The early Muslims, though brutal in war, created a sophisticated and organized civil system. For those curious about Islam's beginnings, no book is as original and as evenhanded as this succinct read.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In <i>Muhammad and the Believers: At the Origins of Islam</i>, Donner takes a fresh look at the heart and soul of Islamic history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Joseph Richard Preville</b><b>, </b><b><i>Saudi Gazette</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A learned and brilliantly original, yet concise and accessible study of Islam's formative first century...Donner's explanation of the process by which Muslims came to define themselves is both fascinating and enlightening.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Max Rodenbeck</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;It is an excellent introduction to how and why the faith was born, and explains its proliferation in the Middle East and beyond...Donner uses the original text of the Qur'an and other source materials dating from the same period to piece together the history of the faith. What quickly becomes clear is that Islam, and what it means to be a "Muslim," have both changed dramatically since the early days...<i>Muhammad and the Believers</i> is full...of intriguing questions and challenges readers to reconsider what they think they know about Islam...[It's] a rewarding read.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Dan Sampson</b><b>, </b><b><i>culturemob.com</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Donner is to be commended for posing questions that many mainstream scholars have chosen to leave aside.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Malise Ruthven</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Provocative and accessible...Donner's vision of an "ecumenical Islam" is thought-provoking...Donner's overarching thesis in <i>Muhammad and the Believers</i> is convincing.

Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young man's portrait, his subject's frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes true. Dorian Gray's picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and innocent. After he kills a young woman, "as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife," Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings. "The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden." <p> As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the delightful "When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy." But despite its many languorous pleasures, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore, and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel's drawing-room discussions. Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde's supposed aims, not least "no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style." Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde, defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: "All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment."</p>Oscar Wilde's only published full length novel, is the story of a man who sells his soul for eternal youth. In exchange, what does he give up and what does he gain? This novel, by Wilde is a wonderful soul-searching example of the cost of paradise, and the price of a wish. <p>Read by actor, comedian, novelist, journalist, screenwriter Stephen Fry, Dorian Gray's dilemma comes alive. He has also acted in a variety of films including A Fish Called Wanda, Peter's Friends, and The Wind in the Willows.</p></p><h2>Dictionary of Word Origins: The Histories of More Than 8,000 English-Language Words</h2><p>With over 8000 entries, and written for the general market, this volume uncovers the often surprising connections between words.

She survived, but her world was destroyed. Her training as a philosopher could not help her make sense of things, and many of her fundamental assumptions about the nature of the self and the world it inhabits were shattered.</p><br><p> At once a personal narrative of recovery and a philosophical exploration of trauma, this book examines the undoing and remaking of a self in the aftermath of violence. It explores, from an interdisciplinary perspective, memory and truth, identity and self, autonomy and community. It offers imaginative access to the experience of a rape survivor as well as a reflective critique of a society in which women routinely fear and suffer sexual violence.</p><br><p> As Brison observes, trauma disrupts memory, severs past from present, and incapacitates the ability to envision a future. Yet the act of bearing witness, she argues, facilitates recovery by integrating the experience into the survivor's life's story. She also argues for the importance, as well as the hazards, of using first-person narratives in understanding not only trauma, but also larger philosophical questions about what we can know and how we should live.</p><br><p> Bravely and beautifully written, <i>Aftermath</i> is that rare book that is an illustration of its own arguments.</p></p><p>With a remarkable blend of intensity and logic, <i>Aftermath: Violence and the Remaking of a Self</i> speaks directly to the heart of anyone involved in the recovery of life after trauma. Author Susan Brison, professor of philosophy, shares her survival of rape and attempted murder with depth and passion; you'll witness a personal struggle to survive coupled with the broader issue of coping with sudden violence as an unavoidable fact of life. This book was 10 years in the making, and Brison wisely left her earlier, angrier writings as they originally appeared, followed by calmer, more logical (yet still deeply felt) musings. The change in tone is one survivors will be familiar with. <p> In her search, Brison discusses public reaction to trauma, and the prescription to forget and move on that is so widely recommended. She covers rape, certainly, but also touches on many other types of violence--the acts of war, murder, and abuse that follow us in the headlines. Philosophers from Wittgenstein to Locke are referenced, up to her final comments: "Recovery no longer seems like picking up the pieces of a shattered self. It's facing the fact that there was never a coherent self there to begin with." <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><p>"Susan Brison's <i>Aftermath</i> is a moving personal narrative of a harrowing experience. It is at the same time a thought-provoking philosophical reflection of broad interdisciplinary interest, particularly for the study of trauma and narrative. In both respects, it helps the reader to understand with greater insight and compassion the uneven, arduous movement from victim to survivor and agent in the aftermath of traumatic violence."<b>--Dominick LaCapra, Cornell University, author of <i>Writing History, Writing Trauma</i> and <i>History and Memory after Auschwitz</i></b></p><p>"In <i>Aftermath</i>, Susan Brison dares to cross personal experience with philosophy, proving her point that the only real way to make sense of trauma is to pay attention to, and respect, actual trauma experienced by actual people. This book is an act of personal and intellectual courage, allowing reason, at last, to triumph over tradition."<b>--Helen Benedict, author of <i>Virgin or Vamp: How the Press Covers Sex Crimes</i> and <i>Recovery: How to Survive Sexual Assault</i></b></p><p>"In this wonderfully illuminating book, Susan Brison demonstrates that, in the right hands, the personal is . . . philosophical. Brison's narrative art shows how violence can damage a self and reveals much about the social goods required for moral personhood."<b>--Jonathan Shay, M.D., Ph.D., author of <i>Achilles in Vietnam: Combat Trauma and the Undoing of Character</i> and <i>Odysseus in America</i></b></p><p>"By facing what follows from traumatic abuse without blinking, by refusing to forget that the world can never be as it was, Susan Brison's shatteringly insightful <i>Aftermath</i> reconstructs philosophy as she reinvents survival."<b>--Catharine MacKinnon, University of Michigan and the University of Chicago</b></p><p>"This book is well written, widely accessible, and vastly important for many, many people in and outside philosophy. It is also a book that will contribute to a much-needed transformation of philosophy itself. The author's narrative is gripping, admirably direct, concise, and never self-indulgent. As tricky as it is to take yourself as a 'cas'' to probe the notion of self in philosophy, the author's success in doing so is total. The outcome is a unique and founding work that deserves to be made available quickly and put at the disposal of a very large public."<b>--Mieke Bal, University of Amsterdam</b></p><p>"<i>Aftermath</i> gave me hours of good reading and thinking.

Labeled racist and condescending by some contemporary critics, it remains a shocking, controversial, and powerful work -- exposing the attitudes of white nineteenth-century society toward "the peculiar institution" and documenting, in heartrending detail, the tragic breakup of black Kentucky families "sold down the river." An immediate international sensation, <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> sold 300,000 copies in the first year, was translated into thirty-seven languages, and has never gone out of print: its political impact was immense, its emotional influence immeasurable.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>The King and the Corpse: Tales of the Soul&#39;s Conquest of Evil</h2><p><p>Drawing from Eastern and Western literatures, Heinrich Zimmer presents a selection of stories linked together by their common concern for the problem of our eternal conflict with the forces of evil.

Equally important, what does it take to be <em>happy</em> as a scientist? Drawing on thirty years of experience, Philip Schwartzkroin offers the budding scientist an invaluable glimpse into the day-to-day life of the researcher, filling a huge hole in the education of most would-be scientists--whether undergraduates or high school seniors. <br> As Schwartzkroin points out, many of the most important things researchers learn as they hone their craft are not written down anywhere. And many of these insights come as a surprise to the na�ve and well-meaning student who somehow believes that "doing research" is an occupation that is substantially different from doing a job in "the real world." This book looks at the "job" of science. Starting with suggestions about how to decide whether you'd want to pursue such a career (and if so, how to get started), the book works through some of the obvious topics relevant to a research profession--how to write a paper, give a talk, construct a grant proposal. It also examines less obvious topics that are generally incorporated into a research education only by trial and error--"thinking" like a scientist, negotiating scientific politics, dealing with research ethics, and understanding social interactions. And the book includes many "real-life situations" that may confront the young scientist, along with the author's advice on how to solve these problems. <br> Based on the author's long career in the laboratory and his rich experience mentoring trainees, <em>So You Want to be a Scientist</em> provides information and insights that will help the young scientist make better decisions and choices. It will also be useful to teachers, counselors, and parents for its realistic look at the demands and requirements for success in a research career.<br></p><p><br><strong>Philip A. Schwartzkroin</strong> has been a research scientist for over 35 years. He received degrees from Harvard and Stanford Universities, and has held faculty positions at Stanford University, University of Washington, and University of California-Davis. In his career as a neuroscientist, he has focused his research effort on understanding the basic biology of seizures and epilepsy. <br><br>Dr. Schwartzkroin has published extensively in peer-reviewed journals, and has a long history of successful grant funding from the National Institutes of Health and from private foundations. He has served in numerous professional leadership roles, including president of the American Epilepsy Society, member of the executive committee of the International League Against Epilepsy, and co-editor-in chief of the premier international epilepsy journal Epilepsia. <br><br>He has been recognized for his research contributions with such prestigious awards as the Javits Award from the National Institutes of Health, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Research Recognition Award from the American Epilepsy Society. Through his many years in the laboratory, he has trained and mentored numerous postdoctoral fellows and graduate and undergraduate students many of whom have gone on to establish successful leadership roles in their chosen areas of research. <br><br>Dr. Schwartzkroin currently is Professor of Neurological Surgery at the University of California-Davis, an affiliate of the UC Davis Center for Neuroscience, and holds the Bronte Endowed Chair in Epilepsy Research in the UC Davis School of Medicine.<br><br>"There are too few good books about the positives and negatives of research careers in science, books aimed at young people who need to make choices in high school or college or even in graduate school. Philip A. Schwartzkroin, a neurosurgeon who specializes in epilepsy research, has written such a book. His book has something for everyone from high school through graduate school. His focus is a career in research, and nearly everything he says is equally applicable to careers in all the basic and applied sciences. It's a readable book, and I cannot imagine anyone interested in a career in science not finding it enormously useful."--Dan Agin, as reviewed in <em>The Huffington Post</em><p></p><br>"The author is a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of California, Davis. Here, he offers 'an invaluable glimpse into the day-to-day life of the researcher' and gives advice on deciding 'whether you'd want to pursue such a career (and, if so, how to get started.'"--As featured in the "What's New in Sciences books section of Scibook.org and <em>Science Book News</em><p></p><br>"If you're a confused college student, still grasping for some direction in your life, you may have considered a career in research at some point. It's a little daunting to think about, being such a broad field, but Philip Schwartzkroin's helpful book, <em>So You Want to Be a Scientist?</em> makes it surprisingly navigable. Schwartzkroin has obviously experienced what students are going through; his clear and entertaining narrative outlines the whole process, from applying to grad school to working in a faculty position. He explains the challenges and opportunities students will encounter at every step of the journey, and provides advice and encouragement along the way."--As reviewed in <em>The Observer</em>, the student newspaper of Case Western University<p></p><br><em>So You Want to Be a Scientist?</em>...is intended as an introduction to the job of a research scientist. The intended audience is a student in college or high school who is contemplating such a career. However, even graduate students and post-doctoral fellows may also benefit from the perspective of a highly successful scientist who has trained and mentored many people...Dr. Schwartzkroin offers many insights and suggestions and discusses issues that, although obvious to most researchers, many young students may not have contemplated or even be aware of....While it is only a single person's viewpoint, the book is unbiased and general enough to be useful to almost anyone contemplating or starting a career as a research scientist. Readers will find this book useful for focusing their own thoughts and perceptions about research, and, hopefully, helping them to make some decisions regarding their personal path."--Saurabh R. Sinha, MD, PhD, as reviewed in <em>Epilepsy &amp; Behavior</em><p></p><br>"...a crisp new book that should be on the reading list for all young scientists, Philip Schwartzkroin, a Professor of Neuroscience at the University of California Davis, rolls up his sleeves and quickly dispenses with this fairy tale notion of science in which the lone genius dreams up brilliant ideas that change the world. He lays bare the challenges that young scientists will face and the compromises that they may have to make...That the author can engage in these discussions without detracting from the big, beautiful ideas that draw people into science in the first place is a testament to his skill as a writer and mentor...We live in a time of enormous potential for scientific research, but which often feels plagued by a raging epidemic of angst about science as a career. Schwartzkroin's book, combined with a deeper appreciation of the extended value of a PhD, could be a much-needed antidote."--Reviewed by John E.

Based on his firsthand experience and on his teaching, the volume moves logically--and leisurely--from a brief history of gardens and a detailed lesson on design principles to site assessment and the varieties of landscape possibilities (country, desert, modern, classical) and plant combinations. For almost every toothsome full-color photo, an accompanying schematic gives readers exact information on plantings and placement. Particularly appealing are Brookes's personal nomenclature for horticultural ingredients: herbaceous perennials he calls "pretties"; his garden's focal points are "specials"; structural plants are "skeletons." Also interesting is the chapter on styling--each type of style is treated, helpfully, to a still life by way of illustration. Well worth noting is another fact: The Book of Garden Design was written with American readers in mind. It includes some American landscapes and recommended hardiness zones for plants. Garden Book Club alternate; author tour. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Brookes has based this book on years of teaching at his School of Landscape Design in England. Knowledgeable in both residential garden design and plant care, he has created a very useful outline of design concepts for the homeowner and serious gardener, with many useful diagrams and color illustrations. Brookes covers various styles (e.g., Oriental, cottage), how to measure and draw plans, structural materials (fences, walks, fountains), plant materials, and special situations. Although occasionally slanted toward British style (topiary, statuary, collectors' plants), this definitely fills a niche and will really help those needing a serious outline to take them through a yard redesign.<br><i>- Laura Lipton, Miller Horticulture Lib., Seattle</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Most of P.

Each chapter deals with a major thematic unit of the Pentateuch, and Hamilton provides useful commentary on overarching themes and connections between Old Testament texts.<br> <br>This second edition has been substantially revised and updated. The first edition sold over sixty thousand copies.</p><p>"The strengths of Hamilton's revised <i>Handbook on the Pentateuch</i> include its balanced attention to all five books of the Pentateuch, helpful bibliographies, fair-minded exposure to critical debates and competing viewpoints, sustained attention to theological themes and insights, and a clear and readable style. The book functions as a substantive one-volume commentary on the Pentateuch written from a moderate and informed evangelical perspective."<br>--<b>Dennis Olson</b>, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>"It is a pleasure to recommend this work as an excellent introduction to the first five books of the Bible. Its sensitivity to the literary structures and emphases in the texts as well as its full awareness of classic and contemporary exegetical issues and scholarship provide an essential tool for introducing students and all interested readers to the fascinating world of the Pentateuch."<br>--<b>Richard S. Hess</b>, Denver Seminary<br><br>"The second edition of Hamilton's <i>Handbook on the Pentateuch</i> follows in the tradition of the first. It is not simply a rehearsal of biblical content but offers concise and scholarly summaries and articulations of modern scholarship on the Pentateuch, while also offering well-crafted, traditional, evangelical positions on many difficult issues that confront readers of the Pentateuch. The bibliographies are remarkable and provide valuable guidance to college and seminary students as they begin their own research."<br>--<b>Peter Enns</b>, Eastern University<br><br>"Hamilton has produced a second edition that is even more helpful for present and future generations of Bible students than the first edition. He has succeeded by revising and expanding the first edition with insights garnered from biblical scholarship at large and from his own study as a biblical commentator and college teacher. The book is brimming with information that exhibits the proper balance of comments on ancient backgrounds, critical theories, and the biblical text."<br>--<b>Kenneth A. Mathews</b>, Beeson Divinity School<br><br>"Hamilton achieves with apparent ease what so many only attempt. He unites historical study with literary insight; he integrates diachronic critical concerns with synchronic, structurally sensitive insights; and he deftly places his own fresh reading of the texts in conversation with an astonishing range of scholarly literature that represents the full spectrum of research on the Pentateuch. All this is done within a sound theological framework that allows the text to be heard naturally as a rule of faith for the church."<br>--<b>Lawson Stone</b>, Asbury Theological Seminary<b>Victor P. Hamilton</b> (PhD, Brandeis University), now retired, was professor of Bible and theology at Asbury University for more than thirty-five years.

The book will have strong appeal to three main audiences; those managing capital professionally, those evaluating professional money managers, and those readers who want to manage their own money more effectively.<br><br> The fact that markets and the money management industry have gone through tumultuous change makes the central message of the book all the more powerful...that the key ingredients to successful performance are timeless and true in radically different environments. Those ingredients, an appreciation for the balance of risk versus reward in a trade, discipline, adaptability, an open mind, and intellectual honesty that enables one to learn from mistakes, come to life in Schwager's riveting interviews with a number of managers.<br><br> The characters' stories highlight their very different personalities and lifestyles and are interesting in and of themselves. But it is Schwager's unique ability to illustrate their winning strategies and interweave their personal backgrounds and emotional highs and lows that makes <i>Hedge Fund Market Wizards</i> both a highly entertaining read and learning experience. What most jumps out at the reader is how radically different styles and approaches all share the common traits mentioned above. By exemplifying these traits in a number of managers with seemingly different investment philosophies, whether it be short term vs. long term trading, large capital or small, or technical vs. fundamental analysis, Schwager is able to better highlight their essential importance to successful investing. By highlighting their differences, the common thread of their similarities is much more evident. Schwager reinforces the message with succinct summaries of what these commonalities are throughout the book.<br><br> Whether a reader is a professional money manager or simply managing their own capital, I have no doubt they will find <i>Hedge Fund Market Wizards</i> both entertains and enhances their ability to grow their capital.<br> <i>Stanley Druckenmiller founded Duquesne Capital Management, which compounded at 30% per annum without a single losing year from its inception in 1981 to its closing in 2010.

The last chapter distills the wisdom of the 15 skilled traders interviewed into 40 key market lessons. A sampling is provided below:<br><br> <b>1. There Is No Holy Grail in Trading</b><br> Many traders mistakenly believe that there is some single solution to defining market behavior. Not only is there no single solution to the markets, but those solutions that do exist are continually changing. The range of the methods used by the traders interviewed in Hedge Fund Market Wizards, some of which are even polar opposites, is a testament to the diversity of possible approaches. There are a multitude of ways to be successful in the markets, albeit they are all hard to find and achieve.<br><br> <b>2. Don't Confuse the Concepts of Winning and Losing Trades with Good and Bad Trades</b><br> A good trade can lose money, and a bad trade can make money. Even the best trading processes will lose a certain percentage of the time. There is no way of knowing a priori which individual trade will make money. As long as a trade adhered to a process with a positive edge, it is a good trade, regardless of whether it wins or loses because if similar trades are repeated multiple times, they will come out ahead. Conversely, a trade that is taken as a gamble is a bad trade regardless of whether it wins or loses because over time such trades will lose money.<br><br> <b>3. The Road to Success Is Paved with Mistakes</b><br> Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund, strongly believes that learning from mistakes is essential to improvement and ultimate success. Each mistake, if recognized and acted upon, provides an opportunity for improving a trading approach. Most traders would benefit by writing down each mistake, the implied lesson, and the intended change in the trading process. Such a trading log can be periodically reviewed for reinforcement. Trading mistakes cannot be avoided, but repeating the same mistakes can be, and doing so is often the difference between success and failure.<br><br> <b>4. The Importance of Doing Nothing</b><br> For some traders, the discipline and patience to do nothing when the environment is unfavorable or opportunities are lacking is a crucial element in their success. For example, despite making minimal use of short positions, Kevin Daly, the manager of the Five Corners fund, achieved cumulative gross returns in excess of 800% during a 12-year period when the broad equity markets were essentially flat. In part, he accomplished this feat by having the discipline to remain largely in cash during negative environments, which allowed him to sidestep large drawdowns during two major bear markets. The lesson is that if conditions are not right, or the return/risk is not sufficiently favorable, don't do anything. Beware of taking dubious trades out of impatience.<br><br> <b>5. Volatility and Risk Are Not Synonymous</b><br> Low volatility does not imply low risk and high volatility does not imply high risk. Investments subject to sporadic large risks may exhibit low volatility if a risk event is not present in the existing track record. For example, the strategy of selling out-of-the-money options can exhibit low volatility if there are no large, abrupt price moves, but is at risk of asymptotically increasing losses in the event of a sudden, steep selloff. On the other hand, traders such as Jamie Mai, the portfolio manager for Cornwall Capital, will exhibit high volatility because of occasional very large gains-not a factor that most investors would associate with risk or even consider undesirable-but will have strictly curtailed risk because of the asymmetric structure of their trades. So some strategies, such as option selling, can have both low volatility and large, open-ended risk, and some strategies, such as Mai's, can have both high volatility and constrained risk.<br><br> As a related point, investors often make the mistake of equating manager performance in a given year with manager skill. Sometimes, more skilled managers will underperform because they refuse to participate in market bubbles. The best performers during such periods are often the most imprudent rather than the most skilled managers. Martin Taylor, the portfolio manager of the Nevsky Fund, underperformed in 1999 because he thought it was ridiculous to buy tech stocks at their inflated price levels. This same investment decision, however, was instrumental to his large outperformance in subsequent years when these stocks witnessed a prolonged, massive decline. In this sense, past performance can sometimes even be an inverse indicator. <br> <br><br><p>What makes a great trader? For years, financial industry expert Jack Schwager has picked the brains of remarkable individuals who have consistently beaten the markets to find out the answer. Now, in <i>Hedge Fund Market Wizards: How Winning Traders Win</i>, he talks with some of the world's greatest hedge fund experts, highlighting the lessons to be learned from each so that you can apply their wisdom to your own trading.</p> <p>Over the past few decades, hedge funds have become an increasingly popular investment vehicle, but their explosive growth has made trading more competitive than ever. In <i>Hedge Fund Market Wizards</i>, Schwager shares with readers the invaluable lessons he learned from the fifteen traders profiled, which include some of the industry's legendary figures, each of whom has compiled an exemplary return-to-risk record.</p> <p>From the founder of the world's largest hedge fund to a manager going it alone, the traders interviewed in this book approach their field in radically different ways. But each of them has brought new and unique insights and developed distinct strategies that have allowed them to outperform the markets again and again.</p> <p>Just as he did in his previous bestsellers, <i>Market Wizards</i> and <i>The New Market Wizards, </i> Schwager asks the questions that get to the core of what makes a successful trader tick. Distilling forty essential lessons to be learned from the market luminaries it profiles, <i>Hedge Fund Market Wizards</i> offers valuable guidance and timeless insights for both investment professionals and market enthusiasts looking to improve their trading abilities by learning from the best.</p></p><h2>The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume F: The Twentieth Century and After</h2><p><p><strong>Read by millions of students over seven editions, <em>The Norton Anthology of English Literature</em> remains the most trusted undergraduate survey of English literature available and one of the most successful college texts ever published.</strong></p> Firmly grounded by the hallmark strengths of all Norton Anthologies&#x2015;thorough and helpful introductory matter, judicious annotation, complete texts wherever possible&#x2015;<em>The Norton Anthology of English Literature</em> has been revitalized in this Eighth Edition through the collaboration between six new editors and six seasoned ones.

Based in part on the established Bates Method of eyesight improvement and in part on his own professional and personal discoveries, Meir Schneider's pioneering approach has helped thousands of people successfully treat a host of eye problems, including near- and farsightedness, astigmatism, lazy eye, double vision, glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, retinal detachment, retinitis pigmentosa, and nystagmus.&nbsp;This revised edition includes a new chapter on children's eye health and new research and exercises for specific conditions, i.e., glaucoma and nystagmus, near- and farsightedness.<br>&nbsp;<br> Born blind to deaf parents, Schneider underwent a series of painful operations as a young child and was left with 99 percent scar tissue on the lenses of his eyes, resulting in his being declared incurably blind. At the age of seventeen, he discovered how to improve his vision from less than 1 percent to 55 percent of normal vision with the eye exercises presented in this book. Today Schneider drives a car, reads, and enjoys the benefits of full natural vision. He and his clients prove time and time again how much vision can improve with exercise. His contributions to the field of self-healing are recognized by alternative health practitioners and medical doctors alike.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Vision for Life</i>, Schneider shares forty years of discoveries made on his personal and professional journey. The book details simple but effective techniques to gain great vision such as sunning and palming. Such exercises are not only strengthening but also restorative and deeply relaxing. The reader learns how to reverse developing issues before they cause damage or to remedy existing problems, including pathologies such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, retinal detachment, and optic nerve neuropathy.</p><p>Named one of the ten most inspirational people of Israel by a top national Israeli news program, Meir Schneider is the founder and head teacher of the School for Self-Healing in San Francisco, which offers programs that satisfy the continuing education requirements of the American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA) and the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCBTMB). The School for Self-Healing has helped hundreds of thousands of people seeking solutions to chronic health conditions, including many people with vision problems. Born blind, Schneider taught himself to see and over 40 years developed a pioneering program of healing and recovery for the sighted and the blind, sharing his remarkable results not only at the School for Self-Healing, but also in popular books, CDs, and DVDs.&#x201c;In this generous book, Meir Schneider shares the secrets&#x2014;won through his own movingly documented triumph over near-blindness&#x2014;of strengthening, rejuvenating, and healing the eyes by activating the body&#x2019;s own intelligence. A man of vision in every sense, he offers a program of exercises that is both inspiring and eminently practicable.&#x201d;&#x2015;<b>Timothy&nbsp;Crouse</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>The Boys on the Bus</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have been impressed with the work of Meir Schneider for many years, having personally seen improvements in patients&#x2019; vision of those who have worked with him. The ability of the visual system to adapt and regain function is still full of mysteries.

The best treatment is the one that is directed to the patient&#x2019;s needs, and the best medicine is the one that uses all knowledge and not only a part of it. Traditional science and complementary medicine are tools that should be used together, focusing on a more holistic health concept.&#x201d;&#x2015;<b>Leonardo Verri Paulino, MD</b>, ophthalmologist and anterior segment surgeon at ABC Medical School, Brazil<br><br>&#x201c;Meir&#x2019;s method is effective as a complementary physical therapy for the eyes.&#x201d;&#x2015;<b>Em�lia Ritsuko Yasuoka Assad</b>, ophthalmologist and acupuncturist<br><br> &#x201c;Working with my patients has verified that many sight problems get better and heal by taking up the right habits. Meir presents us with a complete guide to do so. He helps us to regain our trust in the power we have over our vision and our lives. As he says in the book, &#x2018;We all can take the time. We just have to decide that we are worth the time and that the process is worth our while.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;<b>Amelia Salvador</b>, ophthalmologist, Spain<br><br> &#x201c;It is wonderful how each new book by Meir Schneider provokes us to incorporate more and more of the self-healing principles into our lives.&#x201d;&#x2014;L<b>aercio Motoryn, MD</b>, ophthalmologist and homeopath<br><br> &#x201c;I had the pleasure to meet Meir Schneider and use his method when I was finishing my apprenticeship to become a Bachelor of Optometry in 2005. His holistic approach toward visual dysfunctions changed me forever as a professional. His concepts remain present in my appointments, therapies, and lens prescriptions. Meir&#x2019;s work invites us to naturally preserve our organism and to practice healthier visual habits in this very technological world.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Fernando Nassif</b>, optometrist with specialization in orthoptics and visual therapy<br><br> &#x201c;The knowledge and application of the Self-Healing Method was very important to improve my practice as an ophthalmologist. The results attained by my patients and with my own vision are proof of the importance of the union of traditional medicine with complementary therapies. I thank Meir for being such a marvelous instrument for my personal and professional improvement.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Ana Cecilia Gois Franco</b>, ophthalmologist and anterior segment surgeon and naturopath, S�o Paulo, Brazil</p><h2>Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire: What Happens When God&#39;s Spirit Invades the Hearts of His People</h2><p><p><strong>MORE THAN ONE MILLION COPIES SOLD</strong></p><p><strong>For anyone seeking to live at the center of God's purposes, this well-loved book points the way to new spiritual vitality in the church and in your own life. </strong></p><p>A classic must-read for readers looking for hope and transformation in the church today, <em>Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire</em>&nbsp;shows what the Holy Spirit can do when believers get serious about prayer and the gospel. As this compelling book reveals, God moves in life-changing ways - calling us back from spiritual dead ends, apathy, and lukewarm religion - when we set aside our own agendas, take him at his word, and listen for his voice.</p><p>Pastor Jim Cymbala knows from personal experience. Back in the early 1970s his own church, the Brooklyn Tabernacle, was a struggling congregation of twenty. Then they began to pray, God began to move, and street-hardened lives by the hundreds were changed with the love of Christ. Today, they are nearly ten thousand strong.</p><p>In this twentieth&nbsp;anniversary edition, Cymbala updates the classic stories, including that of his own daughter, Chrissy Cymbala Toledo. He talks about how the church has grown and how God helped the church move from its location on Flatbush Avenue to a larger facility that the growing church couldn't "afford" as God continues to dramatically reshape the life stories of so many people who encounter Christ and the power of the gospel. This message of hope and transformation continues.</p><p>Also available in Spanish, <em>Fuego vivo, viento fresco</em>.</p></p><p><p>Jim Cymbala has been the pastor of the Brooklyn Tabernacle for more than thirty-five years. The bestselling author of <em>Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire, </em>he lives in New York City with his wife, Carol Cymbala, who directs the Grammy Award-winning Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>Dean Merrill is the author and coauthor of 46 books, including <em>Sinners in the Hands of an Angry Church</em> and three other Jim Cymbala titles: <em>Fresh Faith</em>, <em>Fresh Power</em>, and <em>You Were Made for More</em>.

"It can be exhilarating, appealing, inspiring, chilling. It is never viewed with indifference: beauty demands to be noticed; it speaks to us directly like the voice of an intimate friend."<br> In a book that is itself beautifully written, renowned philosopher Roger Scruton explores this timeless concept, asking what makes an object--either in art, in nature, or the human form--beautiful. This compact volume is filled with insight and Scruton has something interesting and original to say on almost every page. Can there be dangerous beauties, corrupting beauties, and immoral beauties? Perhaps so. The prose of Flaubert, the imagery of Baudelaire, the harmonies of Wagner, Scruton points out, have all been accused of immorality, by those who believe that they paint wickedness in alluring colors. Is it right to say there is more beauty in a classical temple than a concrete office block, more beauty in a Rembrandt than in an Andy Warhol Campbell Soup Can? Can we even say, of certain works of art, that they are <em>too</em> beautiful: that they ravish when they should disturb. But while we may argue about what is or is not beautiful, Scruton insists that beauty is a real and universal value, one anchored in our rational nature, and that the sense of beauty has an indispensable part to play in shaping the human world. <br> Forthright and thought-provoking, and as accessible as it is stimulating, this fascinating meditation on beauty draws conclusions that some may find controversial, but, as Scruton shows, help us to find greater meaning in the beautiful objects that fill our lives.</p><p><br><strong>Roger Scruton</strong> is research Professor at the Institute for the Psychological Sciences based in Arlington, Virginia. His previous academic affiliations have been Professor of Aesthetics at Birkbeck College, London, and subsequently Professor of Philosophy and University Professor at Boston University. His most recent books are <em>On Hunting</em> (1998), <em>An Intelligent Person's Guide to Modern Culture</em> (1998), <em>Spinoza</em> (1998), and <em>England: an Elegy</em> (2000).<br>As always with Scruton, his prose is exquisite and wonderfully clear, which fact together with the illustrations make his book a thing of beauty itself.

The problem is that the advice we give is often wrong! We might tell them to go up and say &#x201c;Hi&#x201d; or introduce themselves, yet in reality is this is not what socially accepted teens and young adults do to meet new people.</p> <p> When trying to start a conversation with someone you don&#x2019;t know, here&#x2019;s what really works:</p> <br> <p>1. Casually look over at the person to show interest but don&#x2019;t stare.</p> <br> <p>2. Use a prop to make it look like you're focused on something else (e.g., your smartphone).</p> <br> <p>3. Look for a common interest that you both appear to share (e.g., you both have the same phone).</p> <br> <p>4. Make a comment related to the common interest (e.g., &#x201c;I see you have the new iPhone. How do you like it?&#x201d;).</p> <br> <p>5. Trade information about the common interest by asking follow-up questions and sharing related information about yourself (e.g., &#x201c;I love my iPhone&#x201d;).</p> <br> <p>6. Assess the person&#x2019;s interest:</p> <p>a. <i>Are they talking to you?</i></p> <p>b. <i>Are they facing you?</i></p> <p>c. <i>Are they looking at you?</i></p> <br> <p>7. If they seem interested, introduce yourself (e.g., &#x201c;By the way, I&#x2019;m Liz&#x201d;).</p><p>This book offers a groundbreaking approach for helping socially challenged teens and young adults make and keep friends.

With energy and passion, this anthology of writings documents the personal and collective political struggles of Chicana feminists.</p><p>During the turbulent 1960s, Chicanas who funneled blood, sweat, and tears into Mexican American protest movements such as La Raza were often relegated to supporting the men who leapt to the ramparts. Stung by such sexual discrimination and disheartened by--or disinterested in--the largely middle-class Anglo agenda championed by the women's liberation movement, Chicana feminists fought to carve out a niche. Though dry at times, the outspoken essays and writings collected in <i>Chicana Feminist Thought</i> record this struggle as it occurred. Not surprisingly, the writers' voices overlap but don't necessarily blend: one rationalizes machismo and seeks only to redirect it, while another impatiently calls for its end. These writings, from the 1960s to the 1990s, chronicle the development and dissension of Chicana feminists faced with the high-wire balancing act of saving a culture while serving their own needs. The result is an enlightening, thought-provoking piece of feminist history.<strong>Alma Garcia</strong> is Professor of Ethnic Studies and Director of the Women's Studies Program at Santa Clara University.</p><h2>Human Resource Management Applications: Cases, Exercises, Incidents, and Skill Builders, 7th Edition</h2><p>Strengthen your practical understanding of today&#39;s human resource management (HRM) with this single source for actual cases, unique exercises and skill builders.

This remains the only text in the market that offers a comprehensive source of everything and anything to do with Human Resource Management cases, vignettes and skill builders. Further, what appeals to me the most is the sheer variety of choices for each topic. One can choose from a comprehensive/integrative case that challenges students to analyze information from a variety of perspectives and encourages them to generate solutions that capture an integrated approach to HRM. One has a choice of shorter cases called 'incidents" that succinctly capture a key issue or a theme. These shorter cases and incidents have been updated each time to reflect the current trends in HR - from safety and violence at work, to freedom of speech, illegal immigration and so on. Then there are several hands-on practical exercises and skill-builders that my students simply love because they get to actually get their hands dirty and engage in a particular HR activity within the safety of a classroom environment or at home. Many of my students actually keep the book after the class is over and use these skill-builders and exercises to train and/or coach their co-workers and subordinates. Because, this book does such a great job in keeping up with the current HR trends and translating them into "teachable moments" - it offers an excellent and valuable teaching tool that appeals to both instructors and students. One final comment - given that many of the cases and incidents in the book are grounded in some forms of a "real life" case, it makes the material so much more powerful and authentic to work with." - Romila Singh, PhD, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee<br><br>"I consistently use the Cases, Incidents, and Skill Builders. What I like about these is that they allow the students to apply the Human Resource Management information they have learned. Completing the Cases, Incidents, and Skill Builders provides students the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, comprehension, and application of the material. Hence, their mastery of the material." - Dr. Tina C. Elacqua, Le Tourneau University<br><br>"The text is perfect for our course given that we want to focus on all areas of HR. The text is excellent in providing students practical and real-world cases, skill builders, etc. in which they may apply and develop their knowledge. I have found these to be very much aligned to situations they may actually encounter in the workplace." - Stacy Rogers, SPHR, CPRW, Sullivan University</p><h2>MyLab Education with Pearson eText -- Access Card -- Generic</h2><p>For Introduction to Educational Psychology courses.This ISBN provides access to the MyLab Education with Enhanced Pearson eText.

These essays, published together in one volume for the first time, contain many of Greenleaf's best insights into the nature and practice of servant-leadership and show his continual refinement of the servant-as-leader concept. In addition, several of the essays focus on the related issues of spirit, commitment to vision, and wholeness.</p><p>Robert K. Greenleaf, author of the classic Servant-Leadership, was director of management research at AT&amp;T. He held a joint appointment as a visiting lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management and at the Harvard Business School. He died in 1990.<br> Editor Larry C. Spears has been CEO of The Greenleaf Center for Servant-Leadership since 1990. He is the editor and co-editor of several books, including Insights on Leadership and Seeker and Servant.&#x201c;The Power of Servant-Leadership is an extraordinary collection of Robert Greenleaf&#x2019;s finest and most mature essays on servant-leadership, spirit, and wholeness. Today there is a growing worldwide movement of people and organizations&#x2014; deeply committed to servant-leadership&#x2014;who have been inspired by Greenleaf&#x2019;s earlier writings. Beautifully enriched by Peter Vaill&#x2019;s Foreword, Jim Shannon&#x2019;s Afterword, and Larry Spears&#x2019;s Introduction, The Power of Servant-Leadership is a wonderful and unexpected gift to the world. It is destined to become a classic.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Max DePree, author of Leading Without Power and Leadership is an Art<br> </b><br> &#x201c;No one in the past 30 years has had a more profound impact on thinking about leadership than Robert Greenleaf. If we sought an objective measure of the quality of leadership available to society, there would be none better than the number of people reading and studying Robert Greenleaf&#x2019;s writings.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Peter M. Senge, author of The Fifth Discipline<br> </b><br> &#x201c;It is wonderful to have access to Greenleaf&#x2019;s visionary thought in The Power of Servant-Leadership. Every time I read him, I am both humbled and awed. Nearly thirty years ago he wrote clearly and forcefully about the issues that still challenge us today. It is time to act on his visions, and this volume is a great help for stepping into the future that Greenleaf describes so eloquently.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Margaret J. Wheatley, author of Leadership and the New Science, co-author of A Simpler Way<br> </b><br> &#x201c;The most difficult steps, Greenleaf has written, that any developing servant-leader must take, is to begin the personal journey toward wholeness and self-discovery. This new collection of essays, written with exceptional depth and grace, offer Robert Greenleaf&#x2019;s most powerful insights about this journey. Anyone interested in the most subtle yet most important aspects of the emerging leadership paradigm must read this book.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Joseph Jaworski, author of Synchronicity<br> </b><br> &#x201c;In my area of work, I&#x2019;ve found that the concept of servant- leadership is crucial to advance governing boards beyond their current primitive state.

The essays in The Power of Servant- Leadership take on new meaning with each reading and are well worth continuing reflection. We first met Greenleaf in 1978. Each year since, we have grown to discover fresh dimensions within his writing and thought. Like special mentors, these penetrating essays will continue to guide you like the wise words alive in your memory when needed.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Ann McGee-Cooper and Duane Trammell, co-authors of You Don&#x2019;t Have To Go Home From Work Exhausted!<br> </b><br> &#x201c;Bob Greenleaf was the first author on leadership to emphasize that human institutions mean far more than results or success or profits. He believed that we exist in order to cooperate with others to achieve purposes beyond ourselves, for some greater collective good. These splendidly thoughtful essays elaborate on that theme. I&#x2019;ve read each of them over the past 20 or so years, and it&#x2019;s about time they&#x2019;ve been published in one place. A blessing for all of us.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Warren Bennis, Distinguished Professor, Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California, author of Organizing Genius<br> </b><br> &#x201c;We are greatly encouraged to know that the servant-leadership movement will have access to these inspiring and important writings of Robert Greenleaf. These are reflective and burnished works. For many who have had their lives affected by Greenleaf, they will be a promise fulfilled. For those who will be introduced to servant-leadership through these essays, the experience will be a welcoming introduction.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Dr. John C. Burkhardt, Program Director, Leadership and Higher Education, W.K.

Though conceived and composed years ago, Greenleaf is profoundly modern, and with the mature wisdom of experience he guides us to the essence of our current search for meaning and purpose. The Power of Servant-Leadership is an extraordinary collection of a master&#x2019;s work, and Greenleaf&#x2019;s voice will resonate in your soul long after you have read the last word.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Jim Kouzes, Chairman and CEO, TPG/Learning Systems, co-author of The Leadership Challenge and Credibility<br> </b><br> &#x201c;I am honored to add my voice to those in praise of The Power of Servant-Leadership . Even though it has been many years since Robert Greenleaf first gave the world his compelling insights, there has never been a time when we needed servant-leadership more than we need it now. Who knows how long business will be suffering the destructive residue of a generation of gunslinger superstar CEOs who, in their excessively narrow definition of &#x201c;stockholder value,&#x201d; have created workplaces of fear and anxiety? The only salvation of the workplace as a source of personal meaning and purpose is to develop and reinforce manager-leaders who will embrace the values of Robert Greenleaf.

A church's philosophy of ministry is locked into its budget, and so the budget will either stifle or accelerate any attempts to move a congregation toward a biblical model of church health. As such, the church budget is a far more potent pastoral tool than many church leaders realize. <em>Budgeting for a Healthy Church</em> examines each section of the budget in light of Biblical principles to show how a church budget can lock in healthy approaches to ministry. Whereas most books on church budgeting are "how" books, explaining how the budgeting process should work, this is a "what" book, helping church leaders determine the pastoral implications of what they choose to fund in their budgets.</p></p><p><p>Jamie Dunlop has served as Associate Pastor at Capitol Hill Baptist Church in Washington, DC since 2009 where, in addition to general pastoral duties, he oversees administration and adult education and coordinates oversight of several non-profits based at the church.

As Jesus says in the gospel of Matthew, the next chapter of our story begins with "the renewal of all things," by which he means the earth we love in all its beauty, our own selves, and the things that make for a rich life: music, art, food, laughter and all that we hold dear. Everything shall be renewed "when the world is made new."</p><p>More than anything else, how you envision your future shapes your current experience. If you knew that God was going to restore your life and everything you love any day; if you believed a great and glorious goodness was coming to you--not in a vague heaven but right here on this earth--you would have a hope to see you through anything, an anchor for your soul, "an unbreakable spiritual lifeline, reaching past all appearances right to the very presence of God" (Hebrews 6:19).</p><p>Most Christians (most people for that matter) fail to look forward to their future because their view of heaven is vague, religious, and frankly boring. Hope begins when we understand that for the believer <em>nothing is lost</em>. Heaven is not a life in the clouds; it is not endless harp-strumming or worship-singing. Rather, the life we long for, the paradise Adam and Eve knew, is precisely the life that is coming to us. And that life is coming soon.</p></p><p><p>John Eldredge is a bestselling author, a counselor, and a teacher.

He won the Commonwealth Prize, the Paris Review Humour Prize, was twice shortlisted for the Booker Prize for his novels Solomon Gursky Was Here and St. Urbain&#39;s Horseman, and was nominated for an Oscar for his screenplay of The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz. He died in 2001.Brimming with sardonic humor, antic imagination and bravura storytelling skill, Richler's fifth novel (after Joshua Was Here ) is an interlocking account of the outrageously bold and daring eponymous protagonist, and of his would-be biographer, brilliant but alcoholic Moses Berger, obsessed with discovering the mysteries of Solomon's life and--maybe--his death. Perhaps inspired by Canada's Bronfman family, Richler creates the three Gursky brothers, bootleggers turned liquor industry tycoons, who are descended from the legendary rapscallion, lecher and arctic explorer Ephraim Gursky. Ephraim's exploits--among other things, he was a survivor of Sir John Francis's ill-fated 1845 expedition to search for the Northwest Passage--are echoed in the adventures of his grandson Solomon, who fights with his treacherous brother Bernard for control of the burgeoning empire. Engrossed in his Gursky research, Moses abandons his once-promising career and endures the loss of the woman he loves. Constructed jigsaw fashion with kaleidoscopic chronology, the novel takes on the tension of a thriller as several mysteries--Why do the members of an Eskimo tribe wear shawls with four fringes? Is cannibalism a family trait? Did Solomon really die in the plane crash?--escalate simultaneously. As usual, Richler does a perfect, irreverent take on all levels of Canadian society, including impoverished, raunchy backwoodsmen, rabid racists, Jewish parvenus and dessicated blueblood Montrealers. If some of his scenes verge on high camp (a bloody Passover seder is a bit outre) he gives readers their money's worth of humor, suspense and all-round entertainment. 40,000 first printing; BOMC alternate. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Philip Guston: Collected Writings, Lectures, and Conversations (Documents of Twentieth-Century Art)</h2><p>This is the premier collection of dialogues, talks, and writings by Philip Guston (1913&#x2013;1980), one of the most intellectually adventurous and poetically gifted of modern painters.

This fascinating volume includes, among many important topics, critiques of Melanie Klein&#39;s ideas and insights into the work of other psychoanalysts, as well as gems of thought on such concepts as play in the analytic situation, the fate of the transitional object, regression in psychoanalysis, and the use of silence in psychotherapy.</p><p>Donald Winnicott (1896-1971) was trained in paediatrics, a profession that he practiced to the end of his life, in particular at the Paddington Green Children&#39;s Hospital. He began analysis with James Strachey in 1923, became a member of the British Psycho-Analytical Society in 1935, and twice served as its President. He was also a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and of the British Psychological Society.This is a special book. (C. V. Haldipur, M.D. <i>American Journal of Psychotherapy</i>)<br><br>Donald W. Winnicott was one of the leading figures in psychoanalysis in the generation after Freud...The implications of Winnicott's work are vast, both for human development and for the treatment of patients of any age...His contributions make a storehouse of ideas for those who are pressing beyond more classically psychoanalytic formulations, and he is a link between psychoanalysis and adjacent fields of thought. (F. Robert Rodman, M.D)<br><br>Winnicott provides the reader with an exceptionally rich source of thoughts and ideas to 'play' with in ways similar to the children and adolescents he so thoughtfully studied. The inclusion of many here to fore unpublished papers provides the reader with a rare opportunity to eavesdrop on Winnicott as he works his way through patient interviews and reflects on the work of his contemporaries...This volume is a pleasure, both for its content and its insight into the psychoanalytic process. Winnicott's ability to eloquently communicate his thoughts and analyses makes it easy to understand his prominence in the post-World War II psychoanalytic arena. (William R. Jankel <i>Science Books &amp; Films</i>)<br><br>As well as being informative, [this book] is a delight to read. Its value comes from the light it throws on Winnicott as a person and on the evolution of his ideas. In an initial 'Reflection,' Winnicott's wife, Clare, attempts 'to throw some light on D.W.W.'s capacity for playing' (p. 3). In so doing, she tells us a great deal about the man himself and his formative years...It is the playful quality of his writing style that makes it such a pleasure to read...All the important Winnicottian themes are represented in this book: honesty and deceiving, the uses of silence, psychosomatic disorders, the transitional object, fear of breakdown, orgastic pleasure, play in the analytic situation, regression, male and female elements of the self, envy, and, of course, the mother and the baby...Winnicott's technique emerges here with great clarity. As always, he moves back and forth between theory and clinical illustration with beautiful fluidity...All of the essays are fascinating. They are Winnicott in his shirtsleeves, and together they provide a unique supplement to our knowledge about a man who was a major contributor to psychoanalysis. (Sydney E. Pulver, M.D. <i>Psychoanalytic Books</i>)</p><h2>The No-Cry Sleep Solution: Gentle Ways to Help Your Baby Sleep Through the Night</h2><p><p>There are two schools of thought for encouraging babies to sleep through the night: the hotly debated Ferber technique of letting the baby "cry it out," or the grin-and-bear-it solution of getting up from dusk to dawn as often as necessary. If you don't believe in letting your baby cry it out, but desperately want to sleep, there is now a third option, presented in Elizabeth Pantley's sanity-saving book <em>The No-Cry Sleep Solution</em>.</p> <p>Pantley's successful solution has been tested and proven effective by scores of mothers and their babies from across the United States, Canada, and Europe. Based on her research, Pantley's guide provides you with effective strategies to overcoming naptime and nighttime problems. <em>The No-Cry Sleep Solution </em>offers clearly explained, step-by-step ideas that steer your little ones toward a good night's sleep--all with no crying.</p> <p>Tips from The No-Cry Sleep Solution:</p> <ul> <li>Uncover the stumbling blocks that prevent baby from sleeping through the night </li> <li>Determine--and work with--baby's biological sleep rhythms </li> <li>Create a customized, step-by-step plan to get baby to sleep through the night </li> <li>Use the Persistent Gentle Removal System to teach baby to fall asleep without breast-feeding, bottlefeeding, or using a pacifier </li> </ul></p><p><p><b>Elizabeth Pantley</b>, author and parent educator, is frequently quoted in numerous magazines including <i>Parents </i>and<i> Parenting. </i>She and her husband live in Washington state with their four children--and all sleep through the night.</p>Through months of research, personal experience, and working with 60 test case families, I have assembled and organized a wide variety of gentle ways to help your baby sleep through the night. The ideas do not involve letting your baby cry -- not even for a minute. You will create a customized plan for your own family based on the ideas, all within a simple and easy-to-follow framework. It's a method that is as gentle and loving as it is effective.<br> I don't believe babies should be left alone to cry themselves to sleep. Or even left to cry as you pop in every 10 minutes to murmur comforting words without reaching out to touch them. But I also know that you can -- gently and lovingly -- help your baby to sleep peacefully all night long. So give The No-Cry Sleep Solution a try, and plan on seeing some wonderful sleep results.</p><h2>Manderley Forever: A Biography of Daphne du Maurier</h2><p><p><b>The nonfiction debut from beloved international sensation and #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Tatiana de Rosnay: her bestselling biography of novelist Daphne du Maurier.</b></p><p>&#x201c;It's impressive how Tatiana was able to recreate the personality of my mother, including her sense of humor.

It is easy to be overwhelmed by the amount of information we encounter each day. Whether at work, at school, or in our personal endeavors, there&#x2019;s a deepening (and inescapable) need for people to work with and understand information. Information architecture is the way that we arrange the parts of something to make it understandable as a whole. When we make things for others to use, the architecture of information that we choose greatly affects our ability to deliver our intended message to our users. We all face messes made of information and people. I define the word &#x201c;mess&#x201d; the same way that most dictionaries do: &#x201c;A situation where the interactions between people and information are confusing or full of difficulties.&#x201d; &#x2014; Who doesn&#x2019;t bump up against messes made of information and people every day? This book provides a seven step process for making sense of any mess. Each chapter contains a set of lessons as well as workbook exercises architected to help you to work through your own mess.</p><p><b>Who is the book for?</b><br> <b></b><br> I wrote this book for anyone making anything. And vague as I admit that to be, I believe it to be most useful framed that way.&nbsp;<br> <br> Because in my opinion, the same advice could be given to someone organizing a bake sale as someone organizing a global cross-channel campaign. I also think the same high-level process and consideration set could apply to a student making their first website as a major corporation redesigning their digital ecosystem.<br> <br> We have spent the last thousand years inventing ever-stronger ways to transport messages from one point to another. But along the way, we haven't spent as much time considering how our messages will be interpreted and how that might impact the way people understand and use the information that our messages contain.&nbsp;<br> <br> We spend most of the time talking about the practical and predictable parts of our world. The steps we will take, the deliverables we will produce, the thing we are making, even the value we will be creating by doing so, the organization of teams and projects to get us there -- but we spend much less time (if any at all) talking about the perceived meaning of choices we make, the impact language has on our communication's effectiveness, or playing with structures that would best serve our intent before we start to layer on the details of design and execution. I wanted to write a book that taught those lessons.Abby Covert specializes in delivering a highly collaborative information architecture process and teaching those that she works with along the way. Abby speaks and writes under the pseudonym Abby the IA, focusing on sharing information architecture content with those working within the design and technology communities. She teaches information architecture at The School of Visual Arts, Parsons: the New School and General Assembly NYC. Abby prides herself on being an active organizer and mentor within the IA community. She currently serves as the president of the Information Architecture Institute and as an advisor for the Information Architecture Summit. She holds credit for inventing World Information Architecture Day, a free annual conference held simultaneously in dozens of locations across the globe. Now in its fourth year, World IA Day has been held in 50+ cites. Thirty eight more locations have been added for 2015. After ten years of practicing information architecture for clients and writing about it on the web, Abby saw that too few people knew how to practice it for themselves. She decided that the best way to help would be to teach this important practice. And, after two years of teaching without a textbook, Abby told her students that she intended to write the book that was missing: a book about information architecture for everybody. This is that book. In developing this book, Abby wrote more than 75,000 words, clarified the contextual meaning of more than 100 terms, and tested three distinctively different prototypes with readers.</p><h2>Great Gatsby (Wisehouse Classics Edition)</h2><p><p><strong>THE GREAT GATSBY</strong> is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream. Fitzgerald-inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island's north shore-began planning the novel in 1923, desiring to produce, in his words, "something new-something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned." Progress was slow, with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924. His editor, Maxwell Perkins, felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the next winter. Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book's title and he considered a variety of alternatives, including titles that referenced the Roman character Trimalchio; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red, White, and Blue. In its first year, the book sold only 20,000 copies. Fitzgerald died in 1940, believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten. However, the novel experienced a revival during World War II, and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades. Today, The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title "Great American Novel." In 1998, the Modern Library editorial board voted it the 20th century's best American novel and second best English-language novel of the same time period.</p></p><p><b>"A curious book, a mystical, glamourous story of today."</b> - &nbsp;<i>Edwin Clark of The New York Times</i><br><br><b>"[The Great Gatsby] leaves the reader in a mood of chastened wonder. . . a revelation of life . . . a work of art."</b> - <i>C.

It gave him the impetus to produce prolifically in this medium, and to take the text of his art from American farms and sea towns to the coast of England, from the Bahamas to Key West. Watercolor gave his oil paintings their sense of sunlight and freshness and a greater evocation of movement. Highlights of Homer's long career in watercolor are shown in 132 luminous color plates. The informed text was written by a curator of the Yale University Art Gallery. Published in conjunction with an exhibition now touring the United States, this first major survey of Homer's watercolors is recommended for art libraries and general collections. Hara L.

And although many of us have caring, sympathetic&nbsp;men in our lives, there are some things&#x2014;no matter how&nbsp;many times we explain them&#x2014;that they&#x2019;ll never fully understand:&nbsp;what it&#x2019;s like to always wonder if you&#x2019;re being paid as much&nbsp;as the guy at the next desk whose work isn&#x2019;t even as good as yours;&nbsp;how it feels to walk home at night with your keys between your&nbsp;knuckles, wondering if your facial expression is tough enough to&nbsp;scare off assailants but not so tough as to invite aggression; the&nbsp;punch to the gut when someone on the internet threatens you&nbsp;with sexual violence just because you expressed an opinion about&nbsp;a superhero movie. Tell a guy about these and he might just stare&nbsp;at you; tell a gal and she&#x2019;ll <i>get</i> it. These shared experiences help us&nbsp;befriend the girls and women around us. They link us with the&nbsp;kind of bond that&#x2019;s impossible to describe unless you&#x2019;ve felt it.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Female friendship is a <i>thing</i>. So why does TV portray women&nbsp;as catty, competitive, and constantly looking for opportunities to&nbsp;undercut each other? Why do movies often feature a lone &#x201c;token&nbsp;girl&#x201d; (if there are any women at all) in an otherwise entirely male&nbsp;cast? What&#x2019;s up with those weird, jealous feelings toward other&nbsp;women that we might get sometimes? And why doesn&#x2019;t the world&nbsp;recognize the amazing power that comes when girls and women&nbsp;team up, bond, and respect one another?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For starters, until very recently, it was the men doing all the&nbsp;writing&#x2014;men who either didn&#x2019;t think women&#x2019;s stories mattered&nbsp;or, worse, were invested in keeping women in their &#x201c;place,&#x201d;&nbsp;which meant &#x201c;apart from one another.&#x201d; A tale of inspiring female&nbsp;friendship was just <i>too empowering</i>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But that doesn&#x2019;t mean those friendships didn&#x2019;t exist. In fact,&nbsp;if we dig deep enough into history, we find that many women who&nbsp;pushed the boundaries and won victories did so because of&#x2014;and&nbsp;not despite&#x2014;other women. Who else would cheer them on? The&nbsp;first women to be formally educated, the first women to demand&nbsp;suffrage, the first women doctors&#x2014;we owe all these success stories&nbsp;to women supporting women. &#x201c;Girl squads&#x201d; might be trendy&nbsp;these days (and it&#x2019;s a trend I am 100 percent on board with), but&nbsp;they&#x2019;re not at all new. These trailblazing ladies were the first, and&nbsp;arguably the most important squads of all.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fortunately, the tide is turning. Everyone is all about the&nbsp;girl squad. Which is awesome, trust me! But it&#x2019;s more than just&nbsp;a solid hashtag (though it also makes a great hashtag). Believing&nbsp;in the strength of women and girls banding together is a shift&nbsp;in consciousness. Promoting positive ideas about female bonding&nbsp;changes how we interact with our own buds. And the magic&nbsp;power of friendship can help us tear down the barriers that are&nbsp;holding us back.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So while society would rather see us compete against each&nbsp;other instead of care about each other, we don&#x2019;t have to listen. We&nbsp;can draw inspiration from historical gals who&#x2019;ve lifted each other&nbsp;up and do the same in our own lives. We can connect rather than&nbsp;divide. Because why would we want to talk behind another woman&#x2019;s&nbsp;back when we could compliment her sharp-as-<br> heck&nbsp;winged&nbsp;eyeliner or her new career move and watch her face light up?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girl squad is about supporting and believing women&nbsp;when they tell us their stories. It&#x2019;s about stopping the fight over&nbsp;the right to be The Girl in the room and insisting that we<i> all </i>have&nbsp;a seat at the table&#x2014;femmes of all ethnicities, races, classes, sexual&nbsp;orientations, gender identities, and abilities. It&#x2019;s about finally getting&nbsp;the women-dominated&nbsp;entertainment and media we are so<br> desperate for (<i>Ocean&#x2019;s Eight</i>, anyone?). It&#x2019;s about being more together&nbsp;than we are apart.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So let&#x2019;s rewrite the narrative by seeing how much the amazing&nbsp;girl squads of history have already done. Join me on this journey&nbsp;of lady solidarity, and bring your best girl friends along too.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, and hey&#x2014;text me to let me know you got home safe,&nbsp;okay?</p><h2>Cuaderno de pr�ctica to accompany Composici�n: Proceso y s�ntesis</h2><p>The Cuaderno de pr�ctica helps student expand and refine a number of writing tools (control of grammar, range of vocabulary, rhetorical techniques for organizing information) as well as strategies for getting started.

We are now beginning to learn that many forms of psychotherapy, developed in the absence of any scientific understanding of the brain, are supported by neuroscientific findings.<br><br> Louis Cozolino's <em>The Neuroscience of Psychotherapy</em> illustrates in a clearly written and accessible way how the brain's architecture is related to the problems, passions, and aspirations of human beings. As Cozolino so eloquently argues, all forms of psychotherapy-from psychoanalysis to behavioral interventions-are successful to the extent to which they enhance change in relevant neural circuits.<br><br> Beginning with an overview of the intersecting fields of neuroscience and psychotherapy, this book delves into the brain's inner workings, from basic neuronal building blocks to complex systems of memory, language, and the organization of experience. It continues by explaining the development and organization of the healthy brain and the unhealthy brain. Common problems such as anxiety, trauma, and codependency are discussed from a scientific and clinical perspective. Cozolino concludes by introducing the emerging paradigm of the psychotherapist-as-neuroscientist and presents some practical applications of neuroscience to psychotherapy. Throughout the book, the science behind the brain's workings is applied to day-to-day experience and clinical practice.<br><br> Written for psychotherapists and others interested in the relationship between brain and behavior, this book encourages us to consider the brain when attempting to understand human development, mental illness, and psychological health.<br></p><p><strong>Louis Cozolino, PhD</strong>, is professor of psychology at Pepperdine University and a clinician in private practice.

He is the founder and president of Reasons to Believe, and hosts a television series by the same name which is broadcast internationally on TBN. A highly requested speaker on the topics of faith and science, Dr. Ross has appeared on numerous radio and television programs, including &#34;CBS Television News,&#34; &#34;Praise the Lord,&#34; &#34;The 700 Club,&#34; and &#34;Focus on the Family.&#34; He is the author of three other NavPress books: The Creator and the Cosmos, Creation and Time, and The Genesis Question. Dr. Ross and his family live in southern California.Ross (Creation and Time, NavPr., 1994) offers a variation on the argument proving the existence of God. He first examines the implications of the newest discoveries in quantum and particle physics that demonstrate the existence of more than four dimensions. Building also on Einstein's general and special theories of relativity, the author shows that science can not only point the way to the existence of the Creator but can also show that God is and has always been able to operate in all the universe's possible dimensions. Ross applies this extra-dimensionality of God to explain the apparent paradoxes of several theological doctrines (e.g., the Incarnation, the Trinity, free will and predestination, etc.). His blending of theology and science seeks to address the claim made by Paul Davies in his God and the New Physics (1984) that modern science provides a more convincing proof of God's existence than religion. But he weakens his argument by trying to interpret scripture in terms of science. A more successful response to this claim is found in Science, Technology and Religious Ideas (Univ. Pr. of America, 1994), which acknowledges the integrity of each methodology.

Once her fear was overcome, however, she took to writing tales of the supernatural for publication in the magazines of the day. These eleven finely wrought pieces showcase her mastery of the traditional New England ghost story and her fascination with spirits, hauntings, and other supernatural phenomena. Called "flawlessly eerie" by <i>Ms.</i> magazine, this collection includes "Pomegranate Seed," "The Eyes," "All Souls'," "The Looking Glass," and "The Triumph of Night."</p><p>&#34;&#39;No, I don&#39;t believe in ghosts, but I&#39;m afraid of them,&#39; is much more than the cheap paradox it seems to many. To &#39;believe,&#39; in that sense, is a conscious act of the intellect, and it is in the warm darkness of the prenatal fluid far below our conscious reason that the faculty dwells with which we apprehend ghosts.&#34; Edith Wharton, known for her keen observations of an emotionally stifling upper-class social world, was so afraid of ghosts that for many years she couldn&#39;t even sleep in a room with a book containing a ghost story. As horror scholar Jack Sullivan writes, &#34;It is this sharply felt sensation of supernatural dread filtered through a skeptical sensibility that made Wharton a master of the ghost story.&#34; This collection contains 11 of her elegant, chilling tales, including &#34;Afterword,&#34; &#34;The Triumph of Night,&#34; and &#34;Pomegranate Seed,&#34; plus Wharton&#39;s 1937 preface and an autobiographical postscript.<b>Edith Wharton</b> was born in 1862 into one of New York's older and richer families and was educated here and abroad. Her works include <i>The Age of Innocence, Ethan Frome, The House of Mirth,</i> and <i>Roman Fever and Other Stories.</i> As a keen observer and chronicler of society, she is without peer.

Best of all, he includes recipes not just for sauces, but for finished dishes. These recipes give Sauces a broader scope, showing how good cooking and sauce making are intimately related&#x2014;and demonstrating how a correctly prepared sauce can transform a well-cooked dish into something truly sublime.</p> <p>Now, with this new edition, Peterson has thoroughly revised and expanded <em>Sauces </em>to make it even more indispensable. You'll find more than sixty all-new recipes for dishes that showcase the leading role of sauces in cooking, such as Chicken Tagine with Harissa Sauce, Osso Buco with Julienned Vegetables, Lobster � la Nage, and Gold-Plated Chicken with Ginger, Saffron, and Almonds. There are intriguing historical recipes from medieval and seventeenth-century Europe as well as broth-based classics such as Pot au Feu and Bollito Misto. And, by popular request, Peterson at last includes a recipe for traditional American Roast Turkey with Giblet Gravy.</p> <p>This new edition has been completely redesigned to make it easier to use and includes more than thirty beautiful new color photographs of finished dishes with sauces. If you're a fan of the book's previous editions, you should note that Peterson has not cut any recipes for this edition, and that he has reinstated the popular sauce charts that appeared in the first edition.</p> <p>Lively, erudite, and authoritative, <em>Sauces </em>remains the definitive modern work on the subject. And with this edition's additional recipes&#x2014;there are now a total of 440&#x2014;it is now even more valuable as a general cookbook.

Each text acts as a springboard for discussion, a potential class assignment, and a source of inspiration. The book is organized around fourteen topics, from The Player Experience to The Game Design Process, from Games and Narrative to Cultural Representation.

At the same time, in a nearby attic, the painter Johannes Vermeer was using another optical device, a camera obscura, to experiment with light and create the most luminous pictures ever beheld.</p><p>&#x201c;See for yourself!&#x201d; was the clarion call of the 1600s. Scientists peered at nature through microscopes and telescopes, making the discoveries in astronomy, physics, chemistry, and anatomy that ignited the Scientific Revolution. Artists investigated nature with lenses, mirrors, and camera obscuras, creating extraordinarily detailed paintings of flowers and insects, and scenes filled with realistic effects of light, shadow, and color. By extending the reach of sight the new optical instruments prompted the realization that there is more than meets the eye. But they also raised questions about how we see and what it means to see. In answering these questions, scientists and artists in Delft changed how we perceive the world.</p><p>In <em>Eye of the Beholder</em>, Laura J. Snyder transports us to the streets, inns, and guildhalls of seventeenth-century Holland, where artists and scientists gathered, and to their studios and laboratories, where they mixed paints and prepared canvases, ground and polished lenses, examined and dissected insects and other animals, and invented the modern notion of seeing. With charm and narrative flair Snyder brings Vermeer and Van Leeuwenhoek&#x2015;and the men and women around them&#x2015;vividly to life. The story of these two geniuses and the transformation they engendered shows us why we see the world&#x2015;and our place within it&#x2015;as we do today.</p> 16 pages of color illustrations</p><p>Fulbright scholar Laura J.

The language and content of the plays is seen as too difficult for younger children but primary children are underestimated as to what they can accomplish given the challenge. The study of Shakespeare has become an integral part of my grade two program at Hamlet School, in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. </p><p> When I first moved to Stratford, I had no intention of teaching Shakespeare to 7 and 8 year olds. Stratford is a beautiful city noted for its Shakespearean theatre and I was interested that the schools were all named after Shakespearean characters. I asked my class, "Who is William Shakespeare?" and "Why is our school called Hamlet?" Their answers were surprising. One thought he was a famous boxer. Another believed he was the President of Canada. A third student responded, "I don't know who William Shakespeare is. I don't know any of the big kids." It was the children's enthusiasm and excitement on making the connection between an historical figure and the name of their school, which led me to continue. Thirty years later I can't imagine teaching anywhere in the world and not introducing Shakespeare. The study provided tremendous growth, particularly in the area of language and communication and evolved into a learning experience of a lifetime. I have endeavored in my books and workshops for teachers to share the excitement of exploring with children, the timeless emotions and ideas of Shakespeare. </p><p> The comments of two of my children, written at various times in their daily journals show the lasting impression Shakespeare has had on them. </p><p> "Shakespeare is like a big piece of chocolate cake. Once you've started you wish you could go on and on forever, in a non-stopping dream."

Put simply: the story of fruit trees is the story of us.<br><br>Some archaeobotanists argue that fig orchards once dotted the eastern rim of the Mediterranean Sea and eastward toward the upper Euphrates River Valley. These early orchards may have predated the wild progenitors of wheat, barley, oats, emmer, and other ancient grains that propelled humankind into farming some 10,000&#x2013;11,000 years ago. Since then, we have benefited from the presence of trees in the immediate landscape and, more fundamentally and simply, trees on the planet.<br><br>Why grow fruit trees? Like soil stewardship, fruit tree culture is intergenerational. You are growing fruit trees for the next generation and the one after that, too.<br><br>Of course, people grow fruit trees for a variety of reasons&#x2014;for fruit, shade, aesthetic beauty, and (perhaps in a fit of nostalgia for our primate pasts) climbing and swinging through them. Whatever your reason, it&#x2019;s heartening to remember that the act of tending to an organic orchard&#x2014;whether it&#x2019;s one little peach tree or an entire acre of apples&#x2014;can also be a chance to turn back the clock on some of the damage humans have done to the earth. Along with enhancing biodiversity in any garden, planting trees can aid in saving the planet&#x2014;trees sequester atmospheric carbon, essentially modifying the environment and cooling it. When we garden, we should keep in mind that we are very much growing fruit trees in order to <i>grow more trees.<br></i><br><b>A Paradise for Every Garden</b><br><br>For the past forty years, I&#x2019;ve been teaching people how to grow fruit trees organically at the Farm &amp; Garden at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The UCSC Farm &amp; Garden is my office, classroom, curriculum, and lesson plan all rolled into one. The Garden, also known as the Alan Chadwick Garden, is about 3 acres perched on an impossibly steep south-facing slope in central, coastal California. It&#x2019;s been a teaching garden since 1967, when Chadwick, a pioneer of French intensive (organic) gardening, began it as an experiment at the newly founded university. Chadwick was both a formative force and a visionary pioneer in the world of organic growing. In a sense, he was the Rosetta stone for all that has unfolded subsequently in the field. His gardens and those he inspired were at the confluence of technique, science, art, and aesthetics. As organic gardeners, we owe him an extreme debt of gratitude.<br><br>I started as a volunteer at the Farm &amp; Garden in 1972, and after serving as an apprentice in 1974&#x2013;75, I became the manager in 1977. Skip ahead four decades: now I&#x2019;m that old guy leaning on a spade, expounding on the merits of cover crops and compost to a group of idealistic, hardworking apprentices. Nowadays, our apprentices live in tent cabins (not tents, like they used to). In addition to the apprenticeship program, we sell vegetables, flowers, and fruit through a CSA, at a market cart, and to the cafeterias on campus, and we distribute free produce to food pantries on campus, helping to combat food insecurity among students. The program has graduated more than 1,500 apprentices who&#x2019;ve gone on to found and lead organic farms, teaching gardens, and food justice projects around the country and the world.<br><br>My own fruit tree addiction started with apples. The apprentices tease me that after 40 years in the orchard, I still haven&#x2019;t gotten out of the &#x201c;A&#x201d; section of the fruit tree catalog. But why would I need to? One of the advantages of apple trees is that, thanks to an array of size-controlling rootstocks, they lend themselves to intensive plantings and small gardens. But after 10 years of specializing exclusively in apples (more than 120 varieties at last count), the Chadwick Garden orchard is now graced by a collection of stone fruits, including apriums, apricots, peaches, nectarines, plums, and pluots. The truth is, all fruits are great.<br><br>Earlier civilizations, from the Sumerians to the Egyptians to the Greeks, made a lush, fragrant garden the basic mythical setting of paradise, a word sharing the same etymological root as the word <i>garden</i> itself. More accurately, it was an orchard. An orchard as paradise . . . I suppose paradise is certainly a place where existence is positive, harmonious, even timeless.<br><br>From the beginning, I encourage you to think of yourself as an orchardist. It doesn&#x2019;t matter how many trees you have or how big your yard is; your orchard is your own slice of paradise. And while paradise is a place of contentment, it is not a place of luxury, and certainly not idleness. For there is much work and learning to be done, daily, out in the orchard, garden, paradise.<br><br><b>Putting You Where You Can Learn</b><br><br>Gardening is very much a process of observation, decision, action, and reaction. Rinse, repeat. Organic gardening is even more so, because each unique environment, each orchard, will have its own attributes and foibles. In conventional horticulture and agriculture, there are often exact answers to exacting microquestions, but the so-called solutions often provide more problems for the environment and planet. Organic gardening, by contrast, looks at the whole picture&#x2014;the macro and the micro, all in your line of sight. In this book I&#x2019;ll encourage you to understand the ecological systems at work in and around your tree, so you can identify what decisions you need to make and then make them in the service of the tree.<br><br>Fruit tree growing is a managed craft, infused and informed by science. It&#x2019;s important to have meaning and intention behind the food you grow, but in farming, nothing happens without science. While it&#x2019;s true that growing trees is natural, the healthy, productive, aesthetically pleasing fruit tree ... isn&#x2019;t. What the tree might do in the wild often bears little or no resemblance to what you as an orchardist want or need the tree to do to produce a good quantity of quality fruit annually. In an unmanaged situation, a fruit tree&#x2019;s goal is to put fruit and seed on the ground in order to perpetuate its species. A fruit tree does not exist to produce large, annual crops of cosmetically clean fruit. That is the imperative of our particular species. You want good apples? Sweet, juicy pears? It&#x2019;s all&nbsp;about managed intervention, manipulation, behavior modification . . . but all toward a good end. Orchardists have evolved to be master manipulators, with the skills to constantly shape, direct, and redirect tree growth and fruiting with an exacting precision. Rather than manipulation, let&#x2019;s just call it tending trees.<br><br><b>Fruit Trees for All</b><br><br>This book will enable you to select, plant, grow, and manage healthy, productive fruit trees organically, from soil management to irrigation, feeding, and pruning, no matter the size of your orchard. More than just a task list or manual, this book is designed to help you learn to identify the choices you need to make, and then to make good choices. In order to alter the natural growth and fruiting habit of a fruit tree, you will need a thorough understanding of how trees grow&#x2014;their structure, physiology, biology, and growth patterns&#x2014;so you can be equipped to do what you need to do to the tree when you need to do it, with what, how, and why. Along the way, you&#x2019;ll get a strong foundation in French intensive organic gardening&#x2014;learning to care for and improve your soil through cultivation, compost, cover crops, and green manure. (You can apply this knowledge to any type of gardening, but here we&#x2019;re applying it to growing fruit trees.)<br><br>The first sections of the book use deciduous fruit trees as your testing ground&#x2014;specifically, pome fruits (apple, pear, quince) and stone fruits (peach, nectarine, apricot, aprium, pluot, plum, cherry). The truth is, most of what you need to know about fruit trees you can learn from pome and stone fruits. The rest are...well, they&#x2019;re easier. Some of my other favorite fruits to grow&#x2014;citrus, pomegranates, persimmons, and figs&#x2014;have their own considerations later in the book.<br><br>When I was growing up in New England, everybody had to take Latin, a subject with which I was entirely disinterested. (Baseball was more my thing.) But in the years since, I&#x2019;ve schooled myself up a bit. There&#x2019;s a Latin phrase I often translate for my apprentices: <i>a posse ad esse.</i> It means (variously) &#x201c;from the possible to the actual,&#x201d; &#x201c;from being possible to <i>being</i> actual,&#x201d; or &#x201c;from being able to being.&#x201d; As applied to our goals here, the theory goes a little something like this: Of course it is <i>possible</i> to grow fruit trees. Of course it is advisable. But this book will make that real. It is both lexicon and road map.

Reissue.</p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i><p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print". Readers of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> would be hard-pressed to disagree. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

Everyone wants to build the next $100 million business and author Mark Roberge has actually done it using a unique methodology that he shares with his readers. As an MIT alum with an engineering background, Roberge challenged the conventional methods of scaling sales utilizing the metrics-driven, process-oriented lens through which he was trained to see the world. In this book, he reveals his formulas for success. Readers will learn how to apply data, technology, and inbound selling to every aspect of accelerating sales, including hiring, training, managing, and generating demand.</p> <p>As SVP of Worldwide Sales and Services for software company HubSpot, Mark led hundreds of his employees to the acquisition and retention of the company's first 10,000 customers across more than 60 countries. This book outlines his approach and provides an action plan for others to replicate his success, including the following key elements:</p> <ul> <li>Hire the same successful salesperson every time &#x2014; <i>The Sales Hiring Formula</i></li> <li>Train every salesperson in the same manner &#x2014; <i>The Sales Training Formula</i></li> <li>Hold salespeople accountable to the same sales process &#x2014; <i>The Sales Management Formula</i></li> <li>Provide salespeople with the same quality and quantity of leads every month &#x2014; <i>The Demand Generation Formula</i></li> <li>Leverage technology to enable better buying for customers and faster selling for salespeople</li> </ul> <p>Business owners, sales executives, and investors are all looking to turn their brilliant ideas into the next $100 million revenue business. Often, the biggest challenge they face is the task of scaling sales. They crave a blueprint for success, but fail to find it because sales has traditionally been referred to as an art form, rather than a science. You can't major in sales in college. Many people question whether sales can even be taught. Executives and entrepreneurs are often left feeling helpless and hopeless.</p> <p><i>The Sales Acceleration Formula</i> completely alters this paradigm. In today's digital world, in which every action is logged and masses of data sit at our fingertips, building a sales team no longer needs to be an art form. There is a process. Sales can be predictable.</p> <p>A formula does exist.</p></p><p><p><b>Praise for THE SALES ACCELERATION FORMULA</b> </p><p>"A new breed of disciplined, data-driven leaders are re-shaping the field of sales. <i>The Sales Acceleration Formula</i> explains why."<br> <b>&#x2014;Tony Robbins</b> </p><p>"A lot of factors go into building a great sales force, but those factors don't have to be a mystery.

Building the next hundred-million-dollar business requires building a sales team that can get the job done reliably, but, until now, there has been no predictable formula for achieving that goal. Now, a tested formula exists to turn sales from an art into a science, and it's presented in <i>The Sales Acceleration Formula</i>. </p><p>When author Mark Roberge joined HubSpot, it was just another software startup with a big idea but no numbers to prove it would work. In only a few years, Mark took HubSpot past the $100 million revenue mark using the strategy he outlines in <i>The Sales Acceleration Formula</i>. In a world glutted with consultants and thought leaders who have more personality than real knowledge, Mark's story is a significant one. This book contains practical wisdom from a practitioner who has actually overcome the biggest challenge businesses face in the early stages: scaling sales. </p><p><i>The Sales Acceleration Formula</i> deconstructs the process of building revenue into easy, measurable steps. The businesses that successfully make the transition to hundred-million-dollar ventures are those that have mastered five basic tasks: hiring salespeople, training the sales team, managing sales, generating demand, and experimenting with new technologies. Each of these is addressed in <i>The Sales Acceleration Formula</i>, which presents concrete plans for implementing metrics-driven systems that work. Businesses encounter hurdles at every stage of the growth process, so this book provides a framework that can take you from your first sales hire all the way to a fantastic sales team with the motivation to take your business to the next level. </p><p>In today's marketplace, every action is logged, recorded, and stored somewhere. With all that information, we can uncover the scientific principles behind even the most mystifying processes.

With <i>The Sales Acceleration</i> Formula, Mark Roberge is disrupting common knowledge and showing that the journey from $0 to $100 million can be predicted, planned, and measured at every step of the way.</p><p></p></p><h2>Eight Skilled Gentlemen: A Novel (The Chronicles of Master Li and Number Ten Ox)</h2><p><b>The third book in the Chronicles of Master Li and Number Ten Ox series</b><br><br>When a resepcted mandarin is murdered in the heart of the Forbidden City, Master Li and his sidekick, Number Ten Ox, are called in to investigate. Thus begins a Sherlockian adventure that takes Master Li and Number Ten Ox--accompanied by a scarred puppeteer and his shamanka daughter--on a wild chase across China. With murder, mayhem, and magic aplenty, and Chinese folklore and literary references thrown into the mix,<i> Eight Skilled Gentlemen</i> is a hilarious romp through Ancient China.</p><p><b>Barry Hughart</b> is&nbsp;a widely acclaimed writer whose first novel, <i>Bridge of Birds</i>, won the World Fantasy Award for best novel. The other novels in The&nbsp;Chronicles of Master Li and Number Ten Ox series include&nbsp;<i>The Story of the Stone</i>&nbsp;and <i>Eight Skilled Gentlemen</i>.Hughart's ( Bridge of Birds ) third novel is another gem, continuing the adventures of the aging sage Master Li and his youthful sidekick, Number Ten Ox, a delightful pair of ancient Chinese sleuths. When a respected mandarin is murdered by a ch'ih-mei , a vampire ghoul, in broad daylight, the Celestial Master, the most revered Taoist priest in the realm, gives his old friend Master Li the case. The Celestial Master himself, however, seems to be the main suspect after he reports the murder, which he claims was committed with a ball of fire by a man who was then transformed into a crane. Thus commences a wild adventure that takes Master Li and Number Ten Ox from the Forbidden City through backwoods villages and bandit-infested countryside to the sinister palace of Yen-men. There are ghosts, wizards, dog-brides, monsters, puppeteers, female shamans, magic birdcages and, of course, the Eight Skilled Gentlemen, mysterious hooded figures from the dawn of Chinese history who are in league with eight particularly nasty demon-deities. Superbly written and narrated in the humorously observant voice of Number Ten Ox, this is a book not to be missed. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover: Cambridge Lawrence Edition (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>One of the most extraordinary literary works of the twentieth century,&nbsp;<i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i>&nbsp;was banned in England and the United States after its initial publication in 1928.

Yet she is deeply unhappy; married to an invalid, she is almost as inwardly paralyzed as her husband Clifford is paralyzed below the waist. It is not until she finds refuge in the arms of Mellors the game-keeper, a solitary man of a class apart, that she feels regenerated.

Now that we're used to reading about sex, and seeing it in the movies, it's apparent that the novel is memorable for better reasons: namely, that Lawrence was a masterful and lyrical writer, whose story takes us bodily into the world of its characters.The Cambridge edition of Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover is the first ever to restore to Lawrence&#39;s most famous novel the words that he wrote.

Publication of this book, with illustrations by Maurice Sendak, launched the I Can Read series. This much-loved author continues to write stories for children at her home in North Carolina.</p>K-Gr 1&#x2013;In the first book, Little Bear's grandfather is cleaning his attic, and the activity provides both a teaching moment and an opportunity to explore the contents of his sea chest. Little Bear learns about the Marco Polo, and, caught up in the moment, the two share an imaginary trip in the boat, followed by a visit to the nearby docked vessel. Water-washed ink drawings display a series of family vignettes and Little Bear's activities while appropriate simple sentences and childlike questioning keep the pages turning. The two travel around the world through their imaginations, visiting a polar bear, panda, and koala &#x201c;bear.&#x201d; In the second book, the uncomplicated, practical soul introduced in Detective Dinosaur (1996) and Detective Dinosaur Lost and Found (1998, both HarperCollins) returns in a trio of investigations. As he follows instructions literally, &#x201c;undercover work&#x201d; translates to wearing layers of clothes, mysterious blobs under his naptime blanket terrify the Detective, and sunny skies bring an unexpected, puzzling dousing. The dino's genial expressions projected in colorful pen-and-ink and watercolor cartoons follow the action. Conversation and onomatopoeia spice up the text, presented in large font. The good detective always ends a chapter &#x201c;Case Closed.&#x201d; His innocent confusion creates entertaining problems with simple solutions.

Chaucer wrote about everyday people outside the walls of the English court&#x2015;men and women who spent days at the pedal of a loom, or maintaining the ledgers of an estate, or on the high seas. In <em>Chaucer&#x2019;s People</em>, Liza Picard transforms <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> into a masterful guide for a gloriously detailed tour of medieval England, from the mills and farms of a manor house to the lending houses and Inns of Court in London.</p><p>In <em>Chaucer&#x2019;s People</em> we meet again the motley crew of pilgrims on the road to Canterbury. Drawing on a range of historical records such as the Magna Carta, <em>The Book of Margery Kempe</em>, and <em>Cookery in English</em>, Picard puts Chaucer&#x2019;s characters into historical context and mines them for insights into what people ate, wore, read, and thought in the Middle Ages. What can the Miller, &#x201c;big...of brawn and eke of bones&#x201d; tell us about farming in fourteenth-century England? What do we learn of medieval diets and cooking methods from the Cook? With boundless curiosity and wit, Picard re-creates the religious, political, and financial institutions and customs that gave order to these lives.</p></p><p><strong>Liza Picard</strong> is the author of a series of books on the history of London: <em>Elizabeth&#x2019;s London</em>, <em>Restoration London</em>, <em>Dr. Johnson&#x2019;s London</em>, and <em>Victorian London</em>.

I love Spanish food, I've been going there since I was a young boy&#x2014;but until quite recently I don't think people really took the food seriously. Thanks to a handful of really dedicated Spanish chefs and a growing enthusiasm for its rugged flavors, that has all begun to change. To me the underlying point of journeying to Spain would be to discover the 'duende' in the cooking. By that I mean a sense of soul, of authenticity. The word is normally used in flamenco but I think it could be equally applied to the art of Spanish cooking because to my mind, in really good food, there is a communication between the cook and diner that amounts to art."&nbsp; &#x2014;</i>Rick Stein </p><p>In a&nbsp;beautifully designed and illustrated cookbook, Rick Stein has selected&nbsp;more than&nbsp;140 recipes that capture the authentic taste of Spain today. Spanish cooking has a rich history, with flavors reflecting a broad range of cultural influences.

It's a tough read, but definitely a worthwhile one, and the author's personality and strength shine through on every page. Covering the years from 1975 to 1979, the story moves from the deaths of multiple family members to the forced separation of the survivors, leading ultimately to the reuniting of much of the family, followed by marriages and immigrations. The brutality seems unending--beatings, starvation, attempted rape, mental cruelty--and yet the narrator (a young girl) never stops fighting for escape and survival. Sad and courageous, her life and the lives of her young siblings provide quite a powerful example of how war can so deeply affect children--especially a war in which they are trained to be an integral part of the armed forces.

This novel, based on their experiences, focuses on the faith that sustained them during their captivity. Given to different tribes, the sisters are separated and do not see each other again for close to 10 years. Although Barbara is treated well by Galasko, the Indian brave who wants to marry her, life is hard. She never loses her determination to escape, and after several years, she and three other captives manage to flee successfully. What could have been an interesting story of survival is diminished by the book's simplistic tone and lack of nuance. The settlers are beautiful and compassionate, while many Indians are unattractive, cruel, and troubled because they don't believe in one god. The depiction of them is beyond biased and there is no attempt to provide any historical background or explanation for their actions.

Pitting the family of his favorite wife, the controversial Aisha, against supporters of his son-in-law, the philosopher-warrior Ali, the struggle would reach its breaking point fifty years later in Iraq, when soldiers of the first Sunni dynasty massacred seventy-two warriors led by Muhammad's grandson Hussein at Karbala. Hussein's agonizing ordeal at Karbala was soon to become the Passion story at the core of Shia Islam.</p> <p>Hazleton's vivid, gripping prose provides extraordinary insight into the origins of the world's most volatile blend of politics and religion. Balancing past and present, she shows how these seventh-century events are as alive in Middle Eastern hearts and minds today as though they had just happened, shaping modern headlines from Iran's Islamic Revolution to the civil war in Iraq.</p> <p><i>After the Prophet</i> is narrative nonfiction at its finest, and an emotional and political revelation for Western readers. </p> <strong>Lesley Hazleton on <i>After the Prophet</i></strong> <br> <p> </p><p>It began with a question asked after a particularly ghastly suicide bombing in Iraq: "How come Muhammad, the prophet of unity who spoke of one people and one God, left behind him this terrible, unending, bloody legacy of division between Sunni and Shia?" The question haunted me, and led me to the magnificent story of the struggle for leadership after Muhammad's death, an epic as alive and powerful today as when it first happened.</p> <p>I knew then that how I wrote this book was as important as what I wrote. I had discovered a story so rich in characters, culminating in such a tragic and unforgettable sacrifice, that it would have made a writer like Gabriel Garcia Marquez green with envy. Of course--how else could it survive and gather power over so many centuries? How else inspire people to forfeit their lives and those of others in its name? Yet though it is deeply engraved in Muslim consciousness--to the Sunnis as history and to the Shia as sacred history--the story of the events that divide them has remained largely unknown in the West. And our ignorance of it has haunted us as one Western power after another has tried to intervene in a conflict they barely understand.</p> <p>That's why I wanted to bring Western readers inside the story, to make it as alive for them as it is in the Middle East, so that they can not only understand it on an intellectual level, but experience it--grasp its emotive depth and its inspirational power, and thus understand how it has survived and even strengthened, and how it affects the lives of all of us today.</p> <p>The subject was all the more irresistible to me personally since it brings together many of my deepest interests: the interplay of religion and politics, more intricately intertwined in the Middle East than anywhere else in the world; my own experience living in and reporting from the Middle East for <i>Time</i> magazine and other publications; my affinity for narrative nonfiction and for tracing the interplay of past and present; and my original training as a psychologist, which comes into play as I explore the story, the way it has endured, and how it is used today in politics, society, spiritual life, and, too often, war.</p> <p>I could almost imagine that if all this had only been better known in the West, American troops would never have been sent within a hundred miles of Iraqi holy cities like Najaf and Karbala, which figure in it so largely, and that we would never have tried to intervene in an argument fueled by such a volatile blend of emotion, religion, and politics. But I know this is wishful thinking. In the end, I will be happy if readers simply turn over the last page and breathe out the words I found myself saying again and again as my research deepened, and that seem to me an entirely appropriate response to a story of this power: "Oh my God..." <i>--Lesley Hazleton</i></p> <p>(Photo � Lesly Wiener)</p><p><b>Lesley Hazleton</b>&nbsp;is an award-winning writer whose work focuses on the intersection of religion, history, and politics.

This new edition of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, commemorating the 150th anniversary of its publication, includes an introduction by renowned historian Eric Hobsbawm which reminds us of the document's continued relevance. Marx and Engels's critique of capitalism and its deleterious effect on all aspects of life, from the increasing rift between the classes to the destruction of the nuclear family, has proven remarkably prescient. Their spectre, manifested in the <i>Manifesto</i>'s vivid prose, continues to haunt the capitalist world, lingering as a ghostly apparition even after the collapse of those governments which claimed to be enacting its principles."A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of Communism." So begins one of history's most important documents, a work of such magnitude that it has forever changed not only the scope of world politics, but indeed the course of human civilization. The Communist Manifesto was written in Friedrich Engels's clear, striking prose and declared the earth-shaking ideas of Karl Marx. Upon publication in 1848, it quickly became the credo of the poor and oppressed who longed for a society "in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all." <br>The Communist Manifesto contains the seeds of Marx's more comprehensive philosophy, which continues to inspire influential economic, political, social, and literary theories. But the Manifesto is most valuable as an historical document, one that led to the greatest political upheaveals of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and to the establishment of the Communist governments that until recently ruled half the globe. <br>This Bantam Classic edition of The Communist Manifesto includes Marx and Engels's historic 1872 and 1882 prefaces, and Engels's notes and prefaces to the 1883 and 1888 editions.</p><h2>An Old Betrayal: A Charles Lenox Mystery (Charles Lenox Mysteries, 7)</h2><p><p><b>In <i>An Old Betrayal</i>, the seventh book of Charles Finch's bestselling series of Victorian mysteries, a case of mistaken identity has Charles Lenox playing for his highest stakes yet: the safety of Queen Victoria herself.</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>On a spring morning in London, 1875, Charles Lenox agrees to take time away from his busy schedule as a Member of Parliament to meet an old prot�g�'s client at Charing Cross.

It was only six o&#x2019;clock. As the hours moved toward midnight these rows would fill, and the voices speaking would grow louder to be heard, but for now many of the Members of Parliament were still attending to the chops, the pints of porter, and the ceaseless gossip of the House&#x2019;s private dining room. <br>In the front bench to the left side of the chamber sat a man with a short beard and kind, intelligent eyes, rather thinner than most gentlemen who were just beyond, as he was, the age of forty. He wore a quiet gray evening suit, and though by now many along the benches had begun to lounge backward and even, in some instances, close their eyes, his face and posture evinced no rebellion against the more or less limitless boredom that the House was capable of inflicting upon its observers. His name was Charles Lenox: Once upon a time he had been a practicing detective, and though he still kept a careful eye upon the criminal world, for some years he had been the Member of Parliament for Stirrington, and politics now comprised the chief work of his life. <br>&#x201c;Lenox?&#x201d; whispered a voice behind him. <br>He turned and saw that it was the Prime Minister. In his early days in Parliament an informal address from such a figure would have awed Lenox, but now, having moved by his own industry from the back benches to the front, he was accustomed to Disraeli&#x2019;s presence&#x2014;if perhaps not his company. Rising to an inconspicuous stoop, he said, &#x201c;Good evening, Prime Minister.&#x201d; <br>Disraeli motioned him down and sat beside him, then went on, still in a low voice, &#x201c;I cannot imagine why you have brought yourself here so early in the evening. Not to hear Swick?&#x201d; <br>Across the aisle, several rows up, a gentleman was speaking. He was Augustus Swick, a notorious crank. His speech had begun several minutes before, with the comforting assertion that in his view England had never been in a worse position. Now he had moved on to more personal issues. As he spoke, his enormous white mustache shook at its fringes. <br>&#x201c;It is 1875, gentlemen, and still I cannot walk across St. James&#x2019;s Street to the Carlton Club without being harassed by every variety of vehicle, your omnibus, your reckless hansom cab, your landau, your rapid, far too rapid, clarence&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Pierpont!&#x201d; called out a lazy voice from a back bench. <br>&#x201c;I am delighted to hear that name, sir!&#x201d; cried Swick, reddening, his brow set so grimly that this profession of delight seemed less than sincere. &#x201c;Yes, Pierpont! I had hoped his name might arise, because I must inquire of this chamber, are we all to go to private expense, as Colonel Pierpont did, to install islands in the middle of every road we wish to cross? Do every man&#x2019;s means extend so far? Can private citizens be expected to bear such a burden? I ask you, gentlemen, where will it end? Will it take a horse trampling me to death in Jermyn Street before the attention of this chamber is drawn to the problem of London&#x2019;s traffic?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;May as well try it and find out,&#x201d; called out the same voice, to mild laughter. <br>Swick, outraged, drew himself up further, and Disraeli, with a wink, took the opportunity to move to the front bench across the aisle&#x2014;for he was a Conservative, though he liked to stop in among his foes for a friendly word when the chamber was empty. He was sharp, this fellow. He had turned out Lenox&#x2019;s own party&#x2019;s leader, William Gladstone, the year before, but since then he had very carefully won around both sides of the House by tempering his imperial ambitions for England with an unexpected social conscience. Just that evening they were going to discuss the Artisans&#x2019; and Labourers&#x2019; Dwellings Improvement Act&#x2014;a bill that sounded as if it might have come from Gladstone himself. <br>In fact, this was why Lenox had come to the chamber early. He had a word to get in. <br>By the time Swick had finished speaking, ten or fifteen more men had filed into the Commons, and the serious business of the evening was near its commencement. The Speaker recognized the only man to stand after Swick&#x2014;Edward Twinkleton, a midlands glue baron. He began to address Disraeli&#x2019;s act. <br>The housing of the poor was a serious issue, perhaps the one to which Lenox had, in recent months, devoted more time than to any other. Only that morning he had driven to the slums of Hungerford to see the problem firsthand. <br>Despite its origin in his own Conservative benches, Twinkleton stood firmly against the bill and was now making a long-winded argument about the idle poor. When he had concluded, Lenox stood up and, after recognition from the Speaker, began his response. <br>&#x201c;The chief issue is not, as my honorable friend presumes, one of the comfort of our poorer citizens, but of their health. May I ask whether he is familiar with the usual, and vile, practice of the builders in these neighborhoods? Commissioned by Her Majesty&#x2019;s government to construct new edifices, they take the very fine gravel we, the taxpayers, have purchased&#x2014;for the construction of the foundation&#x2014;and they sell it on the black market. Then they replace it with something called &#x2018;dry core,&#x2019; gentlemen, a mixture of trash, dead animals, and vegetables. It is only March, but in the summer, I am informed, the smell is beyond belief. Can we rightly call this England, if Parliament gives its endorsement, this evening, to such practices?&#x201d; <br>Lenox sat down and thought he saw Disraeli incline his head slightly across the aisle in thanks&#x2014;though perhaps not. <br>Twinkleton rose. &#x201c;I commend my honorable friend&#x2019;s insight into the issue, and yet it cannot be lost on him that these people have always lived in the city, always in suchlike conditions, and that there seem to be more of them than ever! No amount of dry core reduces their number!&#x201d; <br>Lenox stood to respond. &#x201c;The honorable gentleman from Edgbaston neglects to consider, perhaps, the historical context of our time. During the period of the honorable gentleman&#x2019;s childhood&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;As I did not receive a card from my honorable friend upon the recent occasion of my birthday, I do not see how he can be so certain of my age.&#x201d; <br>This drew a laugh, but Lenox bore onward. &#x201c;During the period of the honorable gentleman&#x2019;s childhood,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;or thereabouts, one in five Britons lived in a city. Now it is edging toward four in five. Even to a very dim intellect that must be acknowledged a change.&#x201d; <br>There was laughter on Lenox&#x2019;s own side now, and a diffident round of hissing and catcalling on the other, all very usual, at this slight, and as Lenox sat down upon the green baize bench, smiling faintly, Twinkleton rose up, his face also traced with amusement, clearly raring for battle. Instead the Speaker, chary perhaps of any further devolution of courtesy in the chamber, chose to call for rebuttal on Montague, a Member from Liverpool. Twinkleton would have his chance again in a moment. In the meanwhile, Montague, who had all the charisma and verve of a dying houseplant, returned the tone of the House&#x2019;s discourse to its proper tedium. <br>When Montague had been speaking for ten minutes or so, Lenox saw that a red-haired boy was approaching him, having darted down one of the aisles. This was Frabbs, his clerk, a bright and attentive lad. He handed Lenox a note. &#x201c;Just came to the office, sir,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; said Lenox. <br>He tore the envelope and read the short note inside. Interesting. &#x201c;Any reply, sir?&#x201d; asked Frabbs. <br>&#x201c;No, but find Graham and ask him whether the vote on this bill will come in this evening, or if he thinks there will be another day of debate. You can signal me from the door, I shall keep an eye on it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; <br>Graham was Lenox&#x2019;s political secretary, his most important ally; it was a position in most instances occupied by some ambitious son of the upper classes, fresh from Charterhouse or Eton, but Graham was, unusually&#x2014;perhaps even uniquely&#x2014;a former servant. For many years he had been Lenox&#x2019;s butler. A compact, sandy-haired, and shrewd fellow, he had taken to his new position without faltering, and now had more to do with the running of Parliament than fully half of the body&#x2019;s own Members. <br>As Montague bore onward, down into the depths of his prepared remarks, Lenox&#x2019;s eyes kept flitting to the side door where Frabbs would appear. Catching himself at it once too often, he smiled: It was the old internal debate, the mild pleasures of Parliament, the sense of duty he felt to be there, laid against the thrill of being out on the hunt. Detective work. <br>Lenox&#x2019;s father had been a great man in the Commons, and now his older brother, Sir Edmund Lenox, stood among the two or three chiefs of the party. For his part, Charles had always taken a great interest in politics, too&#x2014;had sometimes wished that the seat in the family&#x2019;s bestowal, which of course Edmund took upon reaching maturity, might have been his&#x2014;and had been thrilled when he won his own. It felt like an ascent, for in truth many of his class looked upon Lenox&#x2019;s previous career as a folly, even an embarrassment. <br>How he missed the old life! Twice in the past two years he had emerged briefly from retirement, on both occasions in singular circumstances, and now he often thought of those cases, their particular details, with a longing to be back in the middle of them. No morning passed in which he did not pore over the crime columns of the newspapers, coffee growing cold in its cup. <br>He thought of all this because of the note Frabbs had passed him: It had come from his former prot�g� in detection, Lord John Dallington, asking for help on a case. Having read it ten minutes before, Lenox itched with irritation at his position already, eager to be gone from the Commons. <br>It was true that he had promised Disraeli, and several other men, that he would be an assiduous participant in these debates. Still, he had already exchanged words with Twinkleton once, and for an hour or two&#x2019;s absence anyway he would hardly be missed. Particularly if the vote was to be delayed beyond that evening. <br>Ah! There was Frabbs&#x2019;s head, popping around the doorjamb&#x2014;and yes, there was the thumb in the air. With a murmured good-bye to the men on his bench, and a promise that he would return just after the break, Lenox stood and made for the exit, happier than he had been since he left the house that morning. A strange circumstance, Dallington&#x2019;s note had promised. Lenox smiled. Who knew what might await him out there in the great fervid rousing muddle of London? <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Charles Finch</p><h2>The New Tarot Handbook: Master the Meanings of the Cards</h2><p><p>Renowned author Rachel Pollack has spent more than forty years studying and practicing Tarot.

The result is an unprecedented work of eyewitness journalism: the account of Conover's year-long passage into storied Sing Sing prison as a rookie guard, or "newjack."<br><br>As he struggles to become a good officer, Conover angers inmates, dodges blows, and attempts, in the face of overwhelming odds, to balance decency with toughness. Through his insights into the harsh culture of prison, the grueling and demeaning working conditions of the officers, and the unexpected ways the job encroaches on his own family life, we begin to see how our burgeoning prison system brutalizes everyone connected with it. An intimate portrait of a world few readers have ever experienced, <i>Newjack</i>&nbsp;is a haunting journey into a dark undercurrent of American life.</p><p>Most people know it's easier to get into prison than it is to get out. But for a journalist, just getting into Sing Sing, New York's notorious maximum-security prison, isn't easy. In fact, Ted Conover was so stymied by official channels that he took the only way in--other than crime--and became a New York State corrections officer: "I wanted to hear the voices one truly never hears, the voices of guards--those on the front lines of our prison policies, the society's proxies." <i>Newjack</i> is Conover's account of nearly a year at ground zero of the criminal justice system. What it reveals is a mix of the obvious and the absurd, with hypocrisies not unexpected considering that the land of the free shares with Russia the distinction of having the world's largest prison population. As of December 1999, it was projected that the number of people incarcerated in the United States would reach 2 million in 2000. <p> This is the world Conover enters when he, along with other new recruits, undergoes seven weeks of pseudomilitary preparation at the Albany Training Academy. Then it's off to Sing Sing for the daily grind of prison life. Conover correctly and vividly captures the essence of that life, its tedium interspersed with the adrenaline rush of an "incident" and the edge of fear that accompanies every action. He also details how the guards experience their own feelings of confinement, often at the hands of the inmates: </p><blockquote> A consequence of putting men in cells and controlling their movements is that they can do almost nothing for themselves. For their various needs they are dependent on one person, their gallery officer. Instead of feeling like a big, tough guard, the gallery officer at the end of the day often feels like a waiter serving a hundred tables or like the mother of a nightmarishly large brood of sullen, dangerous, and demanding children. When grown men are infantilized, most don't take to it too nicely. </blockquote> And not taking to it nicely often involves violence. Indeed, the constant potential for violence on any scale makes even humdrum assignments dangerous. It's astonishing that more <i>doesn't</i> happen, given that the majority of the 1,800 inmates have been convicted of violent felonies: murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery, assault, kidnapping, burglary, arson. But beneath the simmering rage rests an unexpected sensitivity that Conover captures brilliantly. After encountering a Hispanic inmate with a tattoo of a heartbreaking passage from <i>The Diary of Anne Frank</i> on his back, he writes: "It was easier to stay incurious as an officer. Under the inmates' surface bluster, their cruelty and selfishness, was almost always something ineffably sad." Ultimately, the emphasis of Conover's work is on the toll prison exacts--most immediately on the jailed and their jailers, but also on a society that puts both there in increasing numbers. <i>--Gwen Bloomsburg</i>&#x201c;An amazing book.... The stories are spellbinding and the telling is clear and cold.&#x201d;&#x2013;<i>The Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>&#x201c;[Conover] has made us fully part of his experience....

Prison books crowd the shelves, but few tell the story from the point of view of the officers who spend eight hours a day doing time, hoping and praying that they make it home that night, hoping and praying that the job allows them to remain human.&#x201d;&#x2013;<i>The San Diego Union-Tribune</i><br></p><h2>Hunter&#39;s Best Friend at School</h2><p><p><strong>A charming picture book about two raccoons and the joys and perils of first friendship.</strong></p><p>Hunter and Stripe are best friends.

He knew the earth was round, and planned a voyage west into the unknown waters of the Atlantic to reach the Indies. But it wasn't until he was 41 years old that Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain gave him the funds, the three ships, and the men to make a voyage. Even though Columbus never reached the Indies, he made a more important discovery. On October 12, 1492, he landed on an island southeast of Florida. Since he thought he had reached the Indies, he called the natives "Indians". Columbus made three more voyages and is credited with discovering the New World. <br><br>For almost thirty years, David Adler&#x2019;s Picture Book Biography series has profiled famous people who changed the world.

She and her husband live in Mexico and often collaborate on their books.Grade 1-3-- Adler includes all the important information about this explorer's early life and later achievements, but his writing style is a bit drier than in the other series entries. He mentions that Columbus's men were cruel to the Indians in his absence and consequently were killed, but otherwise does not convey much sense of the danger involved in the voyages or give many clues to Columbus's character or personality. The Wallners' illustrations, as in the earlier biographies, are framed watercolors that surround the text. They offer a delightful look at Renaissance dress and housing and add immeasurably to the spare text. A list of important dates is appended, and a map of the first voyage is included. Both the text and the illustrations are superior to Robert Young's Christopher Columbus (Silver Pr, 1990), which relies heavily on fictionalized dialogue. There are many books about Columbus appearing at this time, but this title fills the bill for those looking for an attractive picture book presentation of the basic facts. --Jean H.

Nonetheless, Zafar&#x2014;a mystic, poet, and calligrapher of great accomplishment&#x2014;created a court of unparalleled brilliance, and gave rise to perhaps the greatest literary renaissance in modern Indian history. All the while, the British were progressively taking over the Emperor's power. When, in May 1857, Zafar was declared the leader of an uprising against the British, he was powerless to resist though he strongly suspected that the action was doomed. Four months later, the British took Delhi, the capital, with catastrophic results. With an unsurpassed understanding of British and Indian history, Dalrymple crafts a provocative, revelatory account of one the bloodiest upheavals in history.</p></p><p><p>William Dalrymple is the author of seven previous works of history and travel, including&nbsp;<i>City of Djinns,</i>&nbsp;which won the Young British Writer of the Year Prize and the Thomas Cook Travel Book Award; and&nbsp;<i>From the Holy Mountain;</i>&nbsp;<i>White Mughals,</i>&nbsp;which won Britain&#x2019;s Wolfson History Prize.&nbsp;He is a contributor to&nbsp;<i>The New York Review of Books</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker.&nbsp;</i>He divides his time between New Delhi and London.</p><b>Chapter One: A Chessboard King </b><br><br>The marriage procession of Prince Jawan Bakht left the Lahore Gate of the Red Fort at 2 a.m. on the hot summer night of 2 April 1852. <br><br>With a salute from the cannon stationed on the ramparts, and an arc of fireworks and rockets fired aloft from the illuminated turrets of the Fort, the two gates opposite the great thoroughfare of Chandni Chowk swung open. <br><br>The first to emerge were the <i>chobdars</i>, or mace bearers. The people of Delhi have never much liked being restrained by barriers and were in the habit of breaking through the bamboo railings hung with lamps that illuminated the processional route. It was the job of the <i>chobdars</i> to clear a way through the excitable crowd, before the imperial elephants&#x2014;always a little unpredictable in the presence of fireworks&#x2014;appeared lumbering through the gates. <br><br>Two ministers of state on horseback began the procession proper. Shell ornaments were plaited into the horses&#x2019; manes, and bells strung around their necks and fetlocks, and as they rode out, the ministers were attended by servants with <i>punkahs</i> (fans). Then came a troop of Mughal infantry, with polished black shields and curved swords, long lances and fluttering pennons of green and gold. <br><br>The first six of the imperial elephants followed, caparisoned with gold and saffron headcloths embroidered with the Emperor&#x2019;s coat of arms. From the howdahs, officials held aloft the dynastic insignia that had been used by the Mughals since their arrival in India more than three centuries earlier: from one, the face of a rayed sun; from another, two golden fish suspended at each end of a golden bow; from the third, the head of a lion-like beast; from the fourth, a golden Hand of Fatima; from the fifth, a horse&#x2019;s head; and from the last, a <i>chatri</i>, or imperial umbrella. All were made of gold and were raised on gilt staffs from which trailed silken streamers. <br><br>There then emerged in turn a party of red-tunicked Palace servants carrying covered trays of food and gifts for the bride&#x2019;s family; a squadron of camels, with drums beating and guns firing in the air; a small regiment of British sepoys led by Captain Douglas, Commandant of the Palace Guards, all in tight-fitting busbees and blue-and-saffron uniforms, and escorting two light cannon; a troop of Skinner&#x2019;s Horse in their yellow tunics and scarlet sashes, topped by armoured breastplates and medieval-looking helmets; a group of bullock-drawn wagons on which sat several bands of Mughal kettle drummers,&nbsp;<i>shanai</i> players, trumpeters and cymbal clashers; and a European brougham carriage, painted kingfisher blue, containing a party of senior princes, their gilt brocade flashing in the light of the exploding fireworks. <br><br>After each group came parties of torchbearers, holding their flames aloft, interspersed with men holding candles in glass bell jars. There were also gangs of water carriers emptying their skins onto the road&nbsp; in an attempt to settle the billowing summer dust kicked up by the procession. <br><br>After the brougham there came a second, smaller group of younger princes, this time riding on horseback; and among them, in the very centre, rode the groom. Mirza Jawan Bakht was only eleven years old, a young bridegroom even in a society that tended to marry its offspring early in adolesence. Immediately behind the Prince swayed the elephant on which rode the Emperor himself, sitting in his golden howdah and decked out, despite the sweltering night heat, in his state robes and jewels, and attended by his personal bearer holding a peacock fan. The rest of the court followed behind on foot, a great snaking queue stretching back through Chatta Chowk, the Fort bazaar, to the Naqqar Khana Darwaza, or the Gate of the Drum House, in the very centre of the Fort.<br><br>Not long before this, the Emperor and Jawan Bakht had both sat for the Austrian artist August Schoefft. The portrait of Zafar depicts a dignified, reserved and rather beautiful old man with a fine aquiline nose and a carefully trimmed beard. Despite his height and surprisingly broad and muscular build, there is a profound gentleness and sensitivity in his large brown watery eyes with their unusually long lashes. As a teenage prince, Zafar had always appeared in his portraits as a slightly awkward and uncertain figure, plump, visibly ill at ease and thinly bearded. But as youth gave way to middle age he had grown into his looks, and in old age&#x2014;unusually&#x2014;looked finer than ever. Now in his mid-seventies, his cheeks were sallow, his nose more pronounced and his bearing more regal. Yet as the elderly monarch kneels, wearily fingering his beads, there remains in the expression of his dark eyes something unmistakably melancholic; in the set of his full lips there is still that air of sad, patient resignation visible in the earlier pictures. Schoefft shows Zafar a little swamped under the brocade cloth of gold which adorns him, somewhat weighed down by the huge blood-coloured rubies and the strings of vast pearls, each the size of a partridge egg, which seem to hang so heavily around his neck. It is a portrait of a man imprisoned by the trappings of his office. <br><br>By contrast, the young Jawan Bakht, the Emperor&#x2019;s favourite son, seems to relish all the pearls and gems, the jewelled daggers and inlaid swords with which he is bedecked with a lavishness almost equal to that of his father. His expression is different too: knowingly handsome, and oddly cocky and confident for a boy of eleven. He is as strikingly sure of himself as his father appears wearily uncertain.<br><br>One person missing from both the portraits and the wedding procession was the woman who had done more than anything else to bring the marriage about. For months, Zafar&#x2019;s favourite wife, Zinat Mahal, had been preparing for this day. In Mughal tradition, women did not accompany the <i>barat</i> taking the groom to his marriage&#x2014;not even mothers and queens; but every detail of the procession had been planned by her. For Mirza Jawan Bakht was Zinat Mahal&#x2019;s only son, and her one ambition, to which she held consistently throughout her life, was to see Jawan Bakht, Zafar&#x2019;s fifteenth son, placed on the throne at the death of his father. <br><br>The exceptionally lavish wedding she had planned was intended by her to raise the profile of the Prince, and also to consolidate her own place in the dynasty: Jawan Bakht&#x2019;s bride, the Nawab Shah Zamani Begum, who was probably no more than ten years old at the time of the wedding, was Zinat&#x2019;s niece, and her father, Walidad Khan of Malagarh, an important ally of the Queen. While so young a couple would not be expected to consummate their marriage for a year or two, or even to live together, political considerations meant that the marriage should go ahead immediately, without having to wait for the couple to reach puberty. <br><br>As conceived by Zinat, the wedding of Mirza Jawan Bakht was of a scale unparalleled in Delhi in living memory, eclipsing the weddings of all Jawan Bakht&#x2019;s elder brothers. Sixty years later, the young courtier Zahir Dehlavi, whose job it was to oversee the care of the <i>Mahi</i> <i>Maraatib</i>, or Fish Standard, still remembered the aroma of the trays of food from the royal kitchens that had been sent out to every Palace official, and the spectacular entertainments that preceded the main celebration: &#x201c;Such beauty and magnificence had never been seen before,&#x201d; he wrote many years later, in exile in Hyderabad. &#x201c;At least not in my lifetime. It was a celebration I shall never forget.&#x201d;<br><br>The festivities had begun three days before the marriage with a procession from the house of Walidad Khan to the Palace, bearing the principal wedding gifts, followed by fireworks: &#x201c;a brilliant train of elephants, camels, horses and conveyances of every denomination,&#x201d; according to the <i>Delhi Gazette</i>. This led on to the ceremony of the <i>mehndi</i>, when the hands of the couple and their guests, including all the women of the Palace, were decorated with henna; the celebrations would continue for a further seven days beyond the night of the wedding ceremony. <br><br>On the evening of the great procession, at the beginning of the night vigil known as the <i>ratjaga</i>, Zafar had bestowed on Jawan Bakht a wedding veil made of strings of pearls known as a <i>sehra</i>, and simultaneous parties of escalating grandeur had been arranged for the different ranks of the Palace, each with their own musicians and troupes of dancing girls. Selected townspeople were in one courtyard, Palace children and students in another, senior officials in a third, and the princes in a fourth.<br><br>Since Zafar&#x2019;s financial resources rarely matched his spending, let alone that of his wife, much of the initial work for the wedding had involved arranging loans from Delhi moneylenders, who knew from experience what the chances were of seeing their cash again. Since December, the British Resident&#x2019;s diary of court proceedings had been full of Zinat&#x2019;s attempts to procure the large amounts needed, something she achieved in the end with the aid of the notoriously ruthless Chief Eunuch of the Palace, Mahbub Ali Khan. The Palace was repaired, spring-cleaned and superbly decorated with lamps and chandeliers. Getting sufficiently magnificent fireworks was another major concern, with pyrotechnicians from across Hindustan summoned to the Palace throughout January and February to demonstrate their skills.<br><br>The rockets, squibs and Roman candles were still exploding around the great red sandstone curtain walls of the Fort as the wedding procession slowly proceeded westwards down the top of Chandni Chowk, with its trees and central canal glittering in the light of the torches. It snaked onwards, past the gardens of Begum Sumru&#x2019;s haveli, recently taken over by the new Delhi Bank, and through the Dariba&#x2014;now in the light of ten thousand candles and lanterns haloed in dust&#x2014;before veering left and heading under the latticed windows of the courtesans&#x2019; <i>kothis</i> (town houses) lining the Kucha Bulaqi Begum. <br><br>On the procession passed, turning again under the moonlit white marble domes of the Jama Masjid. It then looped down the Khas Bazaar, before skirting the much smaller but beautifully gilt and illuminated domes of the Suneheri Masjid, and on through the Faiz Bazaar into Daryaganj. Here lay the city&#x2019;s great aristocratic palaces, such as the famous <i>kothi</i> of the Nawab of Jhajjar, which, according to Bishop Heber, the Anglican Primate of Calcutta, &#x201c;far exceed in grandeur anything seen in Moscow.&#x201d; Among them lay the procession&#x2019;s destination, the haveli of Walidad Khan.<br><br>On the way, as the Palace diary puts it, &#x201c;His Majesty&#x2019;s officers presented their <i>nazrs</i> [ceremonial gifts] as the procession passed their several dwellings, while HM inspected the illuminations on the road.&#x201d; The conspicuously wealthy streets through which the procession passed were still very much a Mughal creation. In 1852, despite 150 years of decline and political reversals, Delhi was once again the largest pre-colonial city in India&#x2014;a position it had recently regained from Lucknow&#x2014;and as the <i>Dar ul-Mulk</i>, the seat of the Mughal, was the epitome of an elegant Mughal metropolis: &#x201c;In this beautiful city,&#x201d; wrote the poet Mir, &#x201c;the streets are not mere streets, they are like the album of a painter.&#x201d; A similar idea was conveyed by another Delhi writer of the period, who compared the waters of the canals of Delhi&#x2019;s gardens to the burnished border on an illuminated manuscript page: &#x201c;its waters, like mercury, a <i>jadval</i> [margin] of pure silver running over a page of stone.&#x201d;<br><br>At the same time as the ruling houses of Murshidabad and Lucknow were experimenting with Western fashions and Western classical architecture, Delhi remained firmly, and proudly, a centre of Mughal style. There was no question of Zafar turning up in durbar (court) dressed as a British admiral or even a vicar of the Church of England, as had been heard of in the Nawab&#x2019;s court in Lucknow. Nor was there much trace of Western architectural influence in the buildings erected by the later Mughal emperors: Zafar&#x2019;s new gateway at his summer palace, Zafar Mahal, and his delicate floating garden pavilion in Mehtab Bagh, the scented night garden of the Red Fort, were both built in the full Mughal style of Shah Jahan. <br><br>What was true of the court was true of the city: with the single exception of the Delhi Bank&#x2014;formerly the great Palladian Palace of the Begum Sumru&#x2014;the buildings that the marriage procession passed showed little experimentation with Western classical pediments or square Georgian windows, though such attempts at synthesis had long been common in Lucknow, and in Jaipur. In 1852, British additions within the walls of Delhi were limited to a domed church, a&nbsp; classical Residency building recently converted into the Delhi College, and a strongly fortified magazine, all of which stood to the north of the Fort and out of sight of the path of the procession. Moreover, there were still relatively few Europeans in Delhi&#x2014;probably well under a hundred within the walls: as the poet and literary critic&nbsp;Azad later put it, &#x201c;those were the days when if a European was seen&nbsp; in Delhi, people considered him an extraordinary sample of God&#x2019;s handiwork, and pointed him out to each other: &#x2018;Look, there goes a European!&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>Others, it was true, took a less charitable view. So prevalent was the belief among Delhiwallahs that Englishmen were the product of an illicit union between apes and the women of Sri Lanka (or alternatively between &#x201c;apes and hogs&#x201d;) that the city&#x2019;s leading theologian, Shah Abdul Aziz, had to issue a fatwa expressing his opinion that such a view had no basis in the Koran or the Hadiths, and that however oddly the <i>firangis</i> might behave, they were none the less Christians and thus People of the Book. As long as wine and pork were not served, it was therefore perfectly permissible to mix with them (if one should for any strange reason wish to do so) and even, on occasion, to share their food.<br><br>Partly as a result of this lack of regular contact with Europeans, Delhi remained a profoundly self-confident place, quite at ease with its own brilliance and the superiority of its <i>tahzib</i>, its cultured and polished urbanity. It was a city that had yet to suffer the collapse of self-belief that inevitably comes with the onset of open and unbridled colonialism. Instead, Delhi was still in many ways a bubble of conservative Mughal traditionalism in an already fast-changing India. When someone in Shahjahanabad wished to praise another citizen of the city, he would still reach for the ancient yardsticks of medieval Islamic rhetoric, cloaked in time-worn poetic tropes: the women of Delhi were as tall and slender as cypresses; the Delhi men as generous as Feridun, as learned as Plato, as wise as Solomon; their physicans were as skilled as Galen. One man who was quite clear about the virtues of his home city and its inhabitants was the young Sayyid Ahmad Khan: &#x201c;The water of Delhi is sweet to the taste, the air is excellent, and there are hardly any diseases,&#x201d; he wrote. <br><br>"By God&#x2019;s grace the inhabitants are fair and good looking, and in their youth uniquely attractive. Nobody from any other city can measure up to them . . . In particular the men of the city are interested in learning and in cultivating the arts, spending their days and nights reading and writing. If each of their traits were recounted it would amount to a treatise on good conduct."</p><h2>White (Circle Trilogy, 3)</h2><p><p><b>Time Is Running Out In Two Realities.<br></b></p><p>In one world, a lethal virus threatens to destroy all life as scientists and governments scramble to find an antidote.

He wonders why we are so fascinated by altered states of consciousness, do they reveal something about our origins as human beings and our place in nature?</p><p><b>Terence McKenna</b>, author and explorer, has traveled the world to work and live with shamans. He has added to their shared knowledge of rituals his own efforts to preserve the plants used in these ceremonies. Coauthor of <i>The Invisible Landscape</i> and <i>Psilocybin: The Magic Mushroom Grower&#x2019;s Guide</i>, Terence mesmerizes his many lecture audiences with tales of science and shamanism. He lives in Occidental, California, and is co-manager of a botanical garden in Hawaii for endangered tropical plants.The ethnobotanist co-author of Psilocybin: The Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide (not reviewed) puts forth the theory that magic mushrooms are the original ``tree of knowledge'' and that the general lack of psychedelic exploration is leading Western society toward eventual collapse or destruction--controversial statements, to say the least, though the argument's details often prove fascinating. In the beginning, McKenna tells us, there were protohumans with small brains and plenty of genetic competition, and what eventually separated the men from the apes was an enthusiasm for the hallucinogenic mushrooms that grew on the feces of local cattle. Claiming that psilocybin in the hominid diet would have enhanced eyesight, sexual enjoyment, and language ability and would have thereby placed the mushroom-eaters in the front lines of genetic evolution--eventually leading to hallucinogen-ingesting shamanistic societies, the ancient Minoan culture, and some Amazonian tribes today--McKenna also asserts that the same drugs are now outlawed in the US because of their corrosive effect on our male-dominated, antispiritual society. Unconsciously craving the vehicles by which our ancestors expanded their imaginations and found meaning in their lives, he says, we feast on feeble substitutes: coffee, sugar, and chocolate, which reinforce competition and aggressiveness; tobacco, which destroys our bodies; alcohol, whose abuse leads to male violence and female degradation; TV, which deadens our senses; and the synthetics--heroin, cocaine and their variations--which leave us victimized by our own addiction. On the other hand, argues McKenna, magic mushrooms, used in a spiritually enlightened, ritual manner, can open the door to greater consciousness and further the course of human evolution- -legalization of all drugs therefore is, he says, an urgent necessity.

It is an area that continues to attract and fascinate many people, even though it is generally thought to be highly complex and abstract. For some it is associated with the mystical or religious. For others it is known through the metaphysical poets who talk of love and spirituality. This <em>Very Short Introduction</em> goes right to the heart of the matter, getting to the basic and most important questions of metaphysical thought in order to understand the theory: What are objects? Do colors and shapes have some form of independent existence? Is the whole just a sum of the parts? What is it for one thing to cause another rather than just being associated with it? What is possible? Does time pass? By using simple questions to initiate thought about the basic issues around substance, properties, changes, causes, possibilities, time, personal identity, nothingness, and consciousness, Stephen Mumford provides a clear and down-to-earth path through this analytical tradition at the core of philosophical thought.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stephen Mumford</strong> is Professor of Metaphysics at the Department of Philosophy, University of Nottingham, where he is also Head of the School of Humanities and Dean of the Faculty of Arts. His most famous book is <em>Dispositions</em>, but he also authored <em>Laws in Nature</em> and <em>Watching Sport: Aesthetics, Ethics</em> <em>and Emotions</em>. He has also written extensively for general readers, including articles in <em>Times Higher Education</em> magazine, and he is a frequent public speaker.<br>It manages to be jargon-free without sacrificing rigour and complexity. * Times Higher Education Supplement *</p><h2>Asclepius: The Perfect Discourse of Hermes Trismegistus</h2><p><p>"The Asclepius" is one of two philosophical books ascribed to the legendary sage of Ancient Egypt, Hermes Trismegistus, who was believed in classical and renaissance times to have lived shortly after Moses. The Greek original, lost since classical times, is thought to date from the 2nd or 3rd century AD. However, a Latin version survived, of which this volume is a translation. Like its companion, the "Corpus Hermeticum" (also published by Duckworth as "The Way of Hermes"), the "Asclepius" describes the most profound philosophical questions in the form of a conversation about secrets: the nature of the One, the role of the gods, and the stature of the human being. Not only does this work offer spiritual guidance, but it is also a valuable insight into the minds and emotions of the Egyptians in ancient and classical times. Many of the views expressed also reflect Gnostic beliefs which passed into early Christianity.</p></p><p><p>Clement Salaman is a lecturer and retired teacher, and editor of a 7-volume translation of the letters of Marsilio Ficino.</p></p><h2>Dr. Tatiana&#39;s Sex Advice to All Creation: The Definitive Guide to the Evolutionary Biology of Sex</h2><p><p><b>A sex guide for all living things and a hilarious natural history in the form of letters to and answers from the preeminent sexpert in all creation. </b></p><p><i>Dr. Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation</i> is a unique guidebook to sex. It reveals, for example, when necrophilia is acceptable and who should commit bestiality with whom. It discloses the best time to have a sex change, how to have a virgin birth, and when to eat your lover. It also advises on more mundane matters -- such as male pregnancy and the joys of a detachable penis.</p><p>Entertaining, funny, and marvelously illuminating, the book comprises letters from all creatures worried about their bizarre sex lives to the wise Dr. Tatiana (a.k.a. Olivia Judson), the only sex columnist in creation with a prodigious knowledge of evolutionary biology. Fusing natural history with advice to the lovelorn, blending wit and rigor, she is able to reassure her anxious correspondents that although the acts they describe might sound appalling and unnatural, they are all perfectly normal -- so long as you are not a human. In the process, she explains the science behind it all, from Darwin's theory of sexual selection to why sexual reproduction exists at all. Applying human standards to the natural world, in the end she reveals the wonders of both.</p><p>"Delightful . . . Easy to understand and hard to resist, it's sex education at its prime -- accurate, comprehensive, and hilarious." -- Newsweek</p></p><p>Finally, a how-to guide, in the guise of a Q&amp;A advice column, for marching, flying, or slithering into the battle of the sexes, whatever your species. In this entertaining and informative book, evolutionary biologist Olivia Judson presents "letters" from sexually frustrated animals, birds, and insects who ask "Dr. Tatiana" to explain some sexual oddity. For example, "Don't Wanna Be Butch in Botswana" writes, "I'm a spotted hyena, a girl. The only trouble is, I've got a large phallus. I can't help feeling that this is unladylike. What's wrong with me?" Each question leads Dr. T. into a fascinating explanation about the sex life of this species, sprinkled with sprightly stories about other species with similar attributes or behavior.<p>You'll learn why one stick-insect copulation lasts for 10 weeks (to prevent other males from gaining access to the fertile female) and why the black-winged damselfly's penis has bristles (to scrape out his rival's sperm). You'll learn that male and female orangutans masturbate with sex toys fashioned from leaves and twigs, that slugs are hermaphrodites with penises on their heads, and that females in more than 80 species eat their lovers before, during, or after sex. You'll also ponder human sexuality when you learn that "monogamy is one of the most deviant behaviors in biology" (although jackdaws, chinstrap penguins, California mice, and some termites swear by it) and "natural selection, it seems, often smiles on strumpets."</p><p>Highly recommended--you'll read this through just for the fun of it and have plenty of odd facts with which to dazzle your dinner companions. <i>--Joan Price</i></p><p>With a bachelor of science from Stanford and a doctorate from Oxford, <i>Olivia Judson</i> is an evolutionary biologist and award-winning science journalist who has been published in <i>The Economist, Nature, Science, </i>and <i>The Guardian</i>, among other publications.

They use this energy, called <i>chi</i>, to communicate with their herd, express dominance, and sense predators. Hamilton shares safe, simple techniques to make you more receptive to your animal&#x2019;s chi, so you can develop a calm and effective training style that will not only help your horse follow commands, but strengthen the spiritual bond between horse and rider.&nbsp;</p><p>Winner of a 2012 Nautilus Gold AwardHorse training presents unique opportunities to explore powerful spiritual truths. The exercises in <i>Zen Mind, Zen Horse </i>offer everyone who works with horses -- novice or expert -- a new understanding of how humans train and interact with horses and why these two species, one a master predator and the other the ultimate prey animal, have such a deep, natural connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Horses have evolved to understand and respond to the flow of vital energy -- <i>chi </i>-- around them, using it in their body language to communicate with members of their herd, to express dominance, and to sense danger from nearby predators. Being quietly present and receptive to your horse's energy opens the potential of your emotional, intuitive right brain. These simple, safe groundwork techniques reveal a pathway to awakening your deep sensitivity, calm leadership, intuition, and mindfulness.</p><h2>What Is Biodynamics?: A Way to Heal and Revitalize the Earth</h2><p>In 1924&#x2015;in response to questions about the depletion of soils and a general deterioration of crops and livestock&#x2015;Rudolf Steiner gave eight lectures on &#x201c;the spiritual foundations for a renewal of agriculture.&#x201d; Based on his suggestions and spiritual science, generations of farmers, gardeners, viticulturist, and researchers developed biodynamics as a healing, nurturing, holistic, ecological, organic, and spiritual approach to a sustainable care of the Earth. <br><br> Biodynamic methods consider the farm or garden to be a self-contained organism, embedded in the living landscape of the Earth, which is in turn part of a living, dynamic cosmos of vital, spiritual energies. The aim is to increase the health and vitality of the whole, including the farmer or gardener. The biodynamic practitioner follows an alchemical, transformative path of working with the Earth through the nine &#x201c;homeopathic&#x201d; preparations created by Steiner. <br><br> <i>What Is Biodynamics?</i> collects seven seminal lectures&#x2015;four on developing a spiritual perception of nature and three from his <i><b>Agriculture Course,</b></i> dealing with the preparations. Hugh Courtney of the Josephine Porter Institute for Applied Biodynamics contributes an informative, passionate, and visionary introduction. <br><br> Whether you are concerned with the quality of agriculture and gardening in particular or have a broader interest in the ecological crises facing us today, this book offers a transformative approach that can truly change the way we live together on Earth.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>Student Workbook for Milady Standard Esthetics: Fundamentals</h2><p>The Workbook for Milady Standard Esthetics: Fundamentals, 12th edition contains detailed interactive exercises and exam review questions designed to reinforce learning and increase student comprehension but also to prepare students taking their state licensing examinations.

Vibia Perpetua was a young mother who lived in Roman Africa and, at the age of twenty-two, chose to publicly proclaim her Christian faith. She died as a result of her actions, though she did not die alone; she was part of a group of Christian martyrs, including several slaves, who were placed in prison and then executed in Carthage during the birthday celebrations of Emperor Septimius Severus's son in 203 CE. Perpetua's diary contains her account of the days leading up to her martyrdom.<br><br><em>Perpetua's Journey</em> occupies a space between the many works designed primarily for specialists and advanced scholars, who already know a great deal about Perpetua and the history of the Roman Empire, and lives of saints that are intended for general readers. <em>Perpetua's Journey</em> is unique because it combines both sequential art and historical and social commentary, and it places Perpetua's diary in the context of life in Roman North Africa in 203 CE.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jennifer A.

Rea and Clarke's attractive and affordable new treatment will only increase the <em>Passion</em>'s popularity in classrooms, as it supplements its story and ancillary resources with a graphic representation of the text."--Ellen Muehlberger, <em>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</em><p></p><br>"This book is groundbreaking and innovative. Jennifer A. Rea and Liz Clarke combine first-rate historical scholarship with stunning graphics in order to cast new light on Perpetua's journey. This contemporary graphic novel captures the essence of ancient martyr as super-heroine, remaining true to the original author's intent while challenging modern interpreters."--Jonathan Reed, <em>University of La Verne</em><p></p><br>"<em>Perpetua's Journey</em> represents a fresh approach to the study of the <em>Passio Perpetuae et Felicitatis</em>: by including graphic art alongside critical commentary, it offers modern readers a new experience of the text."--L. Stephanie Cobb, <em>University of Richmond</em><p></p><br>"Comprehensive, innovative, and engaging, <em>Perpetua's Journey</em> is notable above all for the immediacy and interest of its graphic content. The book will open up study of the <em>Passio</em> to a broader range of readers than ever before, fostering a more active, serious, and sustained engagement with this singular document and its historical context."--Thomas McGinn, <em>Vanderbilt University</em><p></p><br>"<em>Perpetua's Journey</em> is a timely and impressive work of scholarship and creativity. The introduction, translation, and other supporting materials are detailed, accessible, and balanced, and the graphic representation brings an immediacy-and a new set of questions-to one of antiquity's most fascinating survivals."--Jessica Clark, <em>Florida State University</em><p></p><br>"This engaging book presents students with a new and bold interpretation of the <em>Passio Perpetuae et Felicitatis</em>, a text that has both inspired and troubled readers for generations. Its use of the graphic medium does far more than illustrate the story--it provides an aesthetic interpretation of Perpetua's world and brings vividness to the thoughts and actions of a courageous group of Carthaginian Christians. <em>Perpetua's Journey</em> offers much of interest to those familiar with the text, and opens up to new audiences a work that, in modern times, has been largely the hidden delight of scholars."--Isabel Moreira, <em>University of Utah</em><p></p><br>"This is a terrific new resource for stimulating minds and bringing the past vividly to life. The <em>Passio Perpetuae et Felicitatis</em> is already an amazing story; in the hands of Rea and Clarke, this new edition brings the past to life for a new generation of readers."--Nicola Denzey-Lewis, <em>Brown</em> <em>University</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Severe Clear (A Stone Barrington Novel)</h2><p><b>Someone wants to crash Stone Barrington&#x2019;s party in this <i>New York Times</i> bestseller in Stuart Woods&#x2019;s thrilling series. </b><br><br>Stone Barrington is in Bel-Air, overseeing the grand opening of the ultra-luxe hotel, The Arrington, built on the grounds of the mansion belonging to his late wife, Arrington Carter.<br><br> The star-studded gala will be attended by socialites, royalty, and billionaires from overseas...and according to phone conversations intercepted by the NSA, it may also have attracted the attention of international terrorists.

The NSA was that part of the United States intelligence community responsible for communications surveillance and code breaking, and Hipp was its deputy director for cryptology, so he could park in the underground garage instead of in one of the eighteen thousand parking spaces surrounding the building.</p><p>Feeling smug that he would return to a cool automobile instead of one baking outside, he inserted his ID badge in the elevator panel and rode up to his office on the top floor, which he entered at the stroke of eight a.m., as he did every day. Four people awaited him at his conference table, drinking his coffee.</p><p>Hipp set his briefcase on the conference table and sat down. &#x201c;Tell me something I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he said without preamble.</p><p>The four exchanged some glances and shuffled through their papers.</p><p>Hipp watched them with satisfaction, since he knew they knew there was not much he didn&#x2019;t know.</p><p>&#x201c;How about a cryptology joke?&#x201d; asked one of them, removing a sheet of paper from a stack.</p><p>&#x201c;Amuse me,&#x201d; Hipp said.</p><p>&#x201c;Overnight down at Fort Gordon, one of our computers picked up a twenty-two-second cell phone conversation between someone in Afghanistan and someone in Yemen. The conversation was too brief to pinpoint locations, and much of it was garbled. The funny part is that, in the middle of the conversation, two English words were clearly spoken: &#x2018;the&#x2019; and &#x2018;Arrington.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That is terribly amusing,&#x201d; Hipp said with a straight face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s also very common, since English is a worldwide language, and foreigners often use phrases from or fragments of English.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Does anyone at Fort Gordon, or for that matter, anyone here, have any thoughts on what the words mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; the man said, &#x201c;I Googled it and there were essentially four hits, among a lot of duplication: first, there&#x2019;s some techie businessman named Arrington who&#x2019;s apparently famous in that world; second, there&#x2019;s an old Virginia family by that name; third, there&#x2019;s an Arrington vineyard; and fourth, there&#x2019;s a new hotel opening in Los Angeles called The Arrington. I like that one best because it has the &#x2018;The&#x2019; in front of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me about the hotel,&#x201d; Hipp said.</p><p>&#x201c;You remember the movie star Vance Calder, who was murdered some years back? The hotel is being built on the grounds of his former home, something like twenty acres, in Bel-Air, a top-scale residential community in L.A.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Home of the Bel-Air Hotel, I believe,&#x201d; Hipp replied.</p><p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;The hotel is being named for his widow, n�e Arrington Carter, who herself was murdered early last year. Curiously, both Mr. and Mrs. Calder were murdered by former lovers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Any apparent significance there?&#x201d; Hipp asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Not really, just a coincidence. The hotel is having a grand opening soon&#x2014;apparently it&#x2019;s a hot ticket out there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If it&#x2019;s a hot ticket in L.A.,&#x201d; Hipp observed, &#x201c;there are probably not many invitations circulating in either Afghanistan or Yemen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That occurred to me, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In what language did the cell phone conversation take place?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A combination of Urdu and Arabic. Not enough was captured to make any sense of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Hipp said. &#x201c;Put &#x2018;The Arrington&#x2019; on the phraseology watch list and let&#x2019;s see if anything pops up. I don&#x2019;t think a single mention of the name is grounds for any sort of alert at this point.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; the man said, scribbling a note on the message and setting it aside.</p><p>The meeting went on for another hour, five men trying to find some evil intent in the overnight traffic. At nine thirty, Hipp closed his briefcase and stood up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m due at the White House at eleven,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You people finish up somewhere else. I need the office.&#x201d;</p><p>The four men shuffled out, and Hipp spent a few minutes going over calls and correspondence with his secretary.</p><p>Hipp arrived at the White House at ten forty-five and was admitted to the cabinet room in the West Wing. By eleven there were eight representatives of other intelligence and security agencies present, and the president of the United States entered the room on time. Everyone stood, and he told them to sit, and the meeting began.</p><p>* * *</p><p><b>A</b>n hour and twenty minutes later, the meeting broke, and Hipp went down to the White House Mess to get some lunch before driving back to Fort Meade. He chose a table by himself, but a moment later, the president&#x2019;s chief of staff, Tim Coleman, walked up. &#x201c;Hi, Scott. Mind if I join you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not even a little bit,&#x201d; Hipp replied.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d your meeting go?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like most meetings&#x2014;nothing monumental was decided. Sometimes I think all this Agency cross-talk has gone too far.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know how you feel,&#x201d; Coleman said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I wasn&#x2019;t there.&#x201d;</p><p>A Filipino waiter came with menus, and they ordered.</p><p>A discussion of the troubles of Tiger Woods ensued, and the two men agreed that all the man had to do was to win a couple of tournaments and he&#x2019;d be back on track.

Behind that building, where the Calder pool once was, is the house built for Arrington Carter Barrington and her husband, Stone Barrington, and next to that is the former Calder guest house, now Cottage One.&#x201d;</p><p>Freeman continued to point out the new pool, the par-three, nine-hole golf course, the tennis courts, gymnasium, cottages, and buildings containing rooms for both guests and their traveling staffs. &#x201c;Most of the parking is underground, leaving the roads and paths free for the electric carts that will transport guests and their luggage to their accommodations.</p><p>&#x201c;We have an indoor theater seating three hundred people and an outdoor amphitheater built into the hillside that seats fifteen hundred. There is a mini-mall here, containing a spa, hair salon, and eight top-end shops and boutiques. A guest who arrives having lost all his luggage can reequip himself or herself there in an hour or less.&#x201d;</p><p>Freeman pointed to two large cottages in a secluded corner of the property. &#x201c;These are our two presidential cottages, and after weeks of diplomacy, negotiation, and security planning, I can finally divulge what most of you do not know: two days before our grand opening, the presidents of the United States and Mexico will meet to conduct final negotiations and the signing of a new trade and immigration treaty between the two countries, covering all sorts of things that you will read about in the newspapers. Additionally, both presidents will attend our grand opening celebration.</p><p>&#x201c;The Arrington is an ideal location for such a meeting, especially since it will not yet have any guests except Stone Barrington and his party, and I can assure you that between the United States Secret Service and the people of Strategic Services, there will be security rivaling that of the White House.&#x201d;</p><p>More applause and happy smiles.</p><p>&#x201c;There are two hundred suites, fifty rooms, three restaurants, and everything else a guest&#x2019;s heart could desire. As you may know, Centurion Studios has underwritten the grand opening celebration, and they have taken twenty-five suites for that night. Many of their out-of-town guests will be staying on for some days. Centurion has also seen that the crowd attending the celebration will be a star-studded one. One thousand invitations were sent out all over this country and the world, and I&#x2019;m told that there have been more than nine hundred acceptances. Before you ask, the invitation list is now closed, but then you all had the opportunity of inviting guests.</p><p>&#x201c;Now, I&#x2019;d like to ask Mort Kaplan to take us through the schedule of events on opening day.&#x201d;</p><p>* * *</p><p><b>K</b>aplan stood up. He was a tall, slender, handsome man of around fifty in a Savile Row suit and a tan. &#x201c;Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.&#x201d; Kaplan took them, step by step, through the schedule of the opening day and gave them their suite assignments. &#x201c;Since all of our guests will be arriving on the same day, I would be grateful if you could check into the hotel with your luggage the previous day. The Secret Service will have your names at the gate. We&#x2019;ve rented a fleet of golf carts, which will bear our logo, to supplement our own fleet of electric vehicles, so that will help us deal with the rush. We will also have a dozen check-in stations at the front desk, instead of the usual four. Each guest will receive a rather expensive gift box and a packet of information, including a map of the property, table assignment for dinner, and other amenities.&#x201d;</p><p>Kaplan continued for most of an hour, then thanked everyone and sat down.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Mort,&#x201d; Freeman said. &#x201c;That was very impressive, and I&#x2019;m sure everything will go smoothly. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our meeting. I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll see you all at the grand opening.&#x201d;</p><p>The group chatted among themselves for a few minutes, then filed out and headed for the elevators. Mike Freeman tugged at Stone&#x2019;s sleeve. &#x201c;Stick around for a minute, will you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure, Mike.&#x201d;</p><p>Freeman closed the conference room door and waved Stone to a seat.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking very serious, Mike.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m feeling very serious,&#x201d; he replied.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I had a phone call this morning, a conference call, actually, with the director of the Secret Service, Howard Carroll, and the president&#x2019;s chief of staff, Tim Coleman, whom I believe you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know Coleman, but not Carroll.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They told me that an NSA computer recorded a cell phone conversation between someone in Afghanistan and someone in Yemen. Most of it was garbled, but the words &#x2018;The Arrington&#x2019; in English were discernible.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s disturbing,&#x201d; Stone said, and he felt it.</p><p>&#x201c;Both the White House and the Secret Service feel that a single mention of the hotel&#x2019;s name is not necessarily significant, and they&#x2019;ve put the name on a kind of electronic watch list to see if there&#x2019;s any further chat about it. In the meantime, nobody is panicking&#x2014;yet&#x2014;but we&#x2019;ve agreed that our security for the grand opening should be stepped up even above the present level. We&#x2019;ve twenty-five of our people assigned to the event, and I&#x2019;ve told them I would speak with you and request that another twenty-five of our agents be assigned, plus half a dozen more to serve in the security center, monitoring the hundred and fifty high-definition cameras we have installed around the property.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m certainly agreeable to that and anything else you feel we need,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;And I think we&#x2019;re fortunate to have you as a principal in the hotel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Stone, I&#x2019;ll see to it. When I told the others that our security at the hotel is nearly at White House levels, I wasn&#x2019;t kidding, and now we&#x2019;re ratcheting it up a couple of notches. We&#x2019;ve already made the perimeter of the property highly secure, and there are only four access points, which will be beefed up with concrete barriers. The Secret Service is now going to increase their number of agents, many of them armed with automatic weaponry, and they&#x2019;re bringing in shoulder-fired Stinger ground-to-air missiles and distributing them at high points around the property, in case of an attack from the air. Every airport in Southern California will be alerted to the possibility of airplane rentals by foreign nationals. And every flight plan filed in the area will be checked against the watch lists.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It sounds as though you&#x2019;ve got it covered,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;Tim Coleman has told me that Kate Rule at the CIA is sending out orders to every station to question all informants.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t think of anything you haven&#x2019;t done,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;Neither can I,&#x201d; Mike said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m going to worry about it every day until this event is behind us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So am I,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p><b>3</b></p><p>Stone returned from his meeting at Strategic Services to find Kelli Keane waiting for him. He had completely forgotten the appointment.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, Kelli,&#x201d; he said, shaking her hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I&#x2019;m late. A board meeting ran on a bit.&#x201d; Kelli Keane was a former reporter with the Post who had quit to write magazine pieces. And a biography of Arrington. Stone was uneasy about talking to her, but she had made the point that he could help her be sure that what she had to say in the book was accurate.</p><p>He seated her on the sofa and took a chai...</p></p><h2>Daniel Boone: The Life and Legend of an American Pioneer (An Owl Book)</h2><p><p>Winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for History for 1993</p><p>In the first and most reliable biography of Daniel Boone in more than fifty years, award-winning historian Faragher brilliantly portrays America's famous frontier hero. Drawing from popular narrative, the public record, scraps of documentation from Boone's own hand, and a treasure of reminiscence gathered by nineteenth-century antiquarians, Faragher uses the methods of new social history to create a portrait of the man and the times he helped shape. Blending themes from a much vitalized Western and frontier history with the words and ideas of ordinary people, Faragher has produced a book that will stand as the definitive life of Daniel Boone for decades to come, and one that illuminates the frontier world of Boone like no other.</p></p><p>The legend of the American frontier is largely the legend of a single individual, Daniel Boone, who looms over our folklore like a giant. Boone figures in other traditions as well: Goethe held him up as the model of Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#39;s &#34;natural man,&#34; and Lord Byron devoted several stanzas of his epic poem Don Juan to the frontiersman, calling Boone &#34;happiest of mortals any where.&#34; But folklore is not history, and we are fortunate to have a reliable and factual life of Boone through the considerable efforts of John Mack Faragher. The contradictory admirer of Indians who participated in their destruction, the slaveholder who cherished liberty, the devoted family man who prized solitude and would disappear into the woods for years at a time--the real Boone is far more interesting than the mythical image, and in this book we finally catch sight of him.John Mack Faragher is the Arthur Unobskey Professor of American History at Yale University.

The superpower was Persia, incomparably rich in ambition, gold, and men. The terrorist states were Athens and Sparta, eccentric cities in a poor and mountainous backwater: Greece. The story of how their citizens took on the Great King of Persia, and thereby saved not only themselves but Western civilization as well, is as heart-stopping and fateful as any episode in history.

So it seemed to those who lived in the Zagros, the great chain of peaks which separates the Fertile Crescent from the upland plateau of Iran. Yet these mountains, though savage, were not impassable. One road did snake across them: the most famous in the world, the Khorasan Highway, which led from the limits of the East to the West, and joined the rising to the setting of the sun. In places, as it climbed through the Zagros Mountains, winding along river beds, or threading between jagged pinnacles and ravines, it might be little more than a footpath--but even that, to those who used it, was a miracle enough. Only a beneficent deity, it was assumed, could ever have fashioned such a wonder. Who, and when, no one really knew for sure,* but it was certainly very ancient--perhaps, some said, as old as time itself. Over the millennia, the Khorasan Highway had been followed by any number of travelers: nomads, caravans--and the armies of conquering kings.<br><br>One empire, in particular, for centuries synonymous with cruel and remorseless invincibility, had sent repeated expeditions into the mountains, dyeing the peaks, in its own ferocious vaunt, "like wool, crimson with blood."(1) The Assyrians, inhabitants of what is now northern Iraq, were city-dwellers, a people of the flat, alluvial plains; but to their kings, warlords who had spread terror and extermination as far as Egypt, the Zagros was less a barrier than a challenge. Themselves the patrons of a proud and brilliant civilization, sumptuous with palaces, gardens and canals, the kings of Assyria had always seen it as their duty to flatten resistance in the wilds beyond their frontiers. This, the wilds being what they were, had proved a calling without limit. Not even with their incomparable war machine could the Assyrians pacify all the mountain tribes--for there were some living in the Zagros who clung to the peaks like birds, or lurked in the depths of thick forests, so backward that they subsisted entirely on acorns, savages hardly worthy of the royal attention. These too, however, with regular incursions, could be taught to dread the name of Assyria, and provide her with the human plunder on which her greatness had come increasingly to depend. Again and again, punitive expeditions would return from the mountains to their native plains, to the sacred cities of Ashur, Nimrud and Nineveh, while in their wake, naked and tethered, followed stumbling lines of captives. Increasingly, the Assyrians had fallen into the habit of moving entire populations, shunting them around their empire, transplanting one defeated enemy into the lands of another, there to live in the houses of the similarly transported, to clear weeds from the rubble, or cultivate the abandoned, smoke-blackened fields.<br><br>These tactics had in the end had due effect. By the late eighth century BC, the reaches of the Khorasan Highway had been formally absorbed into the empire and placed under the rule of an Assyrian governor. "Grovelling they came to me, for the protection of their lives," boasted Assyria's greatest king, Sargon II. "Knowing that otherwise I would destroy their walls, they fell and kissed my feet."(2)<br><br>Not that captives were the only source of wealth to be found in the Zagros. Wild and forested though the mountains were, and often bitter the climate, the valleys were famous for their clover-rich pasture. Over the centuries, and in increasing numbers, these had been attracting tribes who called themselves "Arya"--"Aryans": horse-taming nomads from the plateau to the east.(3) Even once settled, these immigrants had preserved many of their ancestors' instincts, filling the valleys of their new homeland with great herds of long-horned cattle, and preferring, wherever possible, to live in the saddle. The Assyrians, no horse-breeders themselves, would speak in wondering terms of the stud farms of the Zagros, with their "numberless steeds."(4) It was relatively easy for the Assyrian army to cherry-pick these as tribute, for the finest horses, by universal consent, were those bred by the Medes, a loose confederation of Aryan tribes settled conveniently along the Khorasan Highway itself. No wonder the Assyrians came to prize the region. Their mastery of Media,(5) as well as enabling them to control the world's most important trade route, permitted their armies to develop a new and lethal quality of speed. By the eighth century BC, cavalry had become vital to the ability of Assyria to maintain her military supremacy. The tribute of horses from the mountains had become the lifeblood of her greatness. The richest silver mine could not have been more precious to her than the stud farms of the Zagros.<br><br>And yet, in Assyria's supremacy lay the seeds of its own downfall. The mountains were a mishmash of different peoples, Aryans and aboriginals alike, with even the Medes themselves ruled by a quarrelsome multitude of petty chieftains. Foreign occupation, however, by imposing a unitary authority upon the region, had begun to encourage the fractious tribes to cohere. By the 670s BC, menaced by the shadowy leader of a formal Median union, the Assyrians' hold on the Zagros started to slip alarmingly. Tribute dried up as its collection became ever more challenging. Open revolts blazed and spread. Over the following decades, the scribes of the Assyrian kings, employed to keep a record of the victories of their masters, ceased to make mention of Media at all.<br><br>This silence veiled an ominous development. In 615 BC, a king who claimed sovereignty over all the clan chiefs of the Medes, Cyaxares by name, joined an alliance of the empire's other rebellious subjects and led his troops from their fastnesses against the Assyrians' eastern flank. The effect of this sudden eruption of the mountain men was devastating. After only three years of campaigning, the inconceivable occurred: Nineveh, greatest of all the strongholds of Assyrian might, was stormed and razed. To the amazement--and joy--of the empire's subject peoples, "the bloody city" was pulverized beneath the hooves of the Median cavalry. "Horsemen charging, flashing sword and glittering spear, hosts of slain, heaps of corpses, dead bodies without end--they stumble over the bodies!"(6)<br><br>Four years later, and all traces of the Assyrian colossus, which for so long had kept the Near East in its shadow, lay obliterated. To the victors, naturally, had fallen the spoils. Media, precipitately elevated to the rank of great power, seized a huge northern swath of the defeated empire. Her kings, no longer small-time chieftains, could now indulge themselves in the occupations proper to their newly won status--throwing their weight around and scrapping with other great powers. In 610 BC, the Medes swept into northern Syria, burning and looting as they went. In 585, they went to war with the Lydians, a people based in the west of what is now Turkey, and only a solar eclipse, manifesting itself over the battlefield, finally persuaded the two sides to draw back. By the terms of a hurriedly patched-up treaty, the Halys, a river flowing midway between Media and Lydia, was established as the boundary between the rival empires, and for the next thirty years, throughout the Near East, peace, and the balance of power, were maintained.(7)<br><br>Not that the new king of Media, Astyages, had any intention of hanging up his saddle. Undistracted now by war with other major empires, he turned his attention instead to the wilds north and east of his kingdom, far distant from the cockpit of the Fertile Crescent. Leading an expedition into the badlands of Armenia and what is now Azerbaijan, he was following in the footsteps of the Assyrian kings, teaching the savages beyond his frontiers to fear his royal name.(8) In other ways, too, the traditions of the great monarchies of the Near East, so alien to those of his own people, still semi-tribal and nomadic as they were, appear to have whetted the ambitions of the Median king. After all, a ruler of Astyages' stature, no less powerful than the King of Lydia or the Pharaoh of Egypt, could hardly be expected to rule his empire from a tent. What the monarchs of more ancient lands had always taken for granted--a palace, a treasury, a mighty capital--Astyages, naturally, had to have as well: proofs of his magnificence raised in gold and blocks of stone.<br><br>Travelers who made the final ascent through the mountains along the Khorasan Highway would see, guarding the approaches to the Iranian plateau ahead of them, a vision which could have been conjured from some fabulous epic: a palace set within seven gleaming walls, each one painted a different color, and on the two innermost circuits, bolted to their battlements, plates of silver and gold. This was Ecbatana, stronghold of the kings of Media, and already, barely a century after its foundation, the crossroads of the world.(9) Commanding the trade of East and West, it also opened up to its master the whole range of the Zagros, and beyond. Here, for the Median clan chiefs, in particular, was a thoroughly alarming development. The surest guarantee of their freedom from royal meddling, and of the continued factionalism of the kingdom itself, had always been the inaccessibility of their private fiefdoms--but increasingly they found themselves subordinated to the reach of Astyages' court. At one time, before the building of the polychrome palace walls, Ecbatana had been an open field, a free meeting place for the tribes, a function preserved in the meaning of its name: "assembly point." But now those days were gone, and the Medes, who had fought so long to liberate themselves from the despots of Nineveh, found themselves the subjects of a despot nearer to home.<br><br>No wonder that later generations would preserve a memory of Astyages as an ogre. No wonder, either, that when they sought to explain their loss of freedom, the Medes would identify Ecbatana as both a symbol of their slavery, and a cause.(10)<br><br><i>King of the World</i><br><br>Astyages, it was said, even amid all the proofs of his greatness, was haunted by prophecies of doom: strange dreams tormented him, warning him of his downfall and the ruin of his kingdom. Such was the value ascribed by the Medes to visions of this kind that a whole class, the Magi, existed to divine what their meaning might be. Skilled in all the arts of keeping darkness at bay, these ritual experts provided vital reassurance to their countrymen, for it was a principle of the Medes, a devout and ethical people, that there was shadow lurking beyond even the brightest light. All the world, it seemed to the Magi, bore witness to this truth. A fire might be tended so that it burned eternally, but there was nowhere, not beside the coolest spring, nor even on the highest mountain peak, where the purity of its flame might not be menaced by pollution. Creation bred darkness as well as the daylight. Scorpions and spiders, lizards, snakes and ants, all crept and seethed, the visible excrescences of a universal shadow. Just as it was the duty of a Magus to kill such creatures wherever he found them, so shadows had to be guarded against when they darkened people's dreams--and especially the nightmares of a king. "For they say that the air is full of spectres, which flow by exhalation, and penetrate into the sight of those with piercing vision."(11) Greatness, like fire, had to be tended with care.<br><br>That a kingdom as powerful as Media, less than a century after its first rise to independence and greatness, might once again be prostrated and subjected to foreign domination must, to many, have seemed implausible. But this, as the Medes themselves had good cause to know, had always been the baneful rhythm of the region's power play: great empires rising, great empires falling. No one kingdom, not even Assyria, had ever crushed all who might wish to see it destroyed. In the Near East, predators lurked everywhere, sniffing the air for weakness, awaiting their opportunity to strike. Ancient states would vanish, new ones take their place, and the chroniclers, in recording the ruin of celebrated kingdoms, might find themselves describing strange and previously unknown peoples.<br><br>Many of these, just like the Medes themselves, were Aryans--nomads who had left little trace of their migrations upon the records of the time. In 843 BC, for instance, the Assyrians had campaigned in the mountains north of their kingdom against a tribe they called the "Parsua"; two centuries later, a people with a very similar name had established themselves far to the south, on the ruins of the venerable kingdom of Anshan, between the lower reaches of the Zagros and the sweltering coastlands of the Gulf. No chronicler, however, could know for sure if they were one and the same.(12) Only by putting down roots, and by absorbing something of the culture of the people they had displaced, had the newcomers finally been able to intrude upon the consciousness of their more sedentary neighbors. These, reluctant to change the habit of centuries, had continued to refer to the region as they had always done; but the invaders, when they spoke of their new homeland, had naturally preferred to call it after themselves. So it was that what had once been Anshan came gradually to be known by a quite different name: Paarsa, Persia, the land of the Persians.(13)<br><br> In 559 bc, while Astyages still ruled in Media, a young man came to the throne of this upstart kingdom. His name was Cyrus, and his attributes included a hook nose, immense ambition and quite limitless ability. From even before his birth, it appeared, he had been marked out for greatness; for it was he--if the stories are to be believed--who had been prophesied as the bane of Median greatness. Astyages was supposed to have seen it all in a dream: a vision of his daughter, Mandane, urinating, the golden stream flowing without cease, until at last the whole of Media had been drowned. When the king had reported this the next morning, his Magian dream-readers had turned pale and warned him that any son of Mandane would be destined to imperil the Median throne. Hurriedly, Astyages had married off his daughter to a vassal, a Persian, the prince of a backward and inconsequential kingdom, hoping in that way to defeat the omen's malice. But after Mandane had fallen pregnant, Astyages had dreamed a second time: now he saw a vine emerging from between his daughter's legs, nor did it stop growing until all Asia was in its shade. Panic-stricken, Astyages had waited for his grandson to be born, and then immediately given orders that the boy be put to death. As invariably happens in such stories, the orders had been defied. The baby had been abandoned on a mountainside, to be discovered and brought up by a shepherd; or perhaps, some said, a bandit; or maybe even a bitch, her teats conveniently swollen with milk. Whatever its precise details, the miraculous nature of such an upbringing had clearly betokened a godlike future for the foundling--and so, of course, it had proved. Cyrus had survived and prospered. Once he had grown to a splendid manhood, his natural nobility of character had served to win him the Persian throne. Thus it was that all the wiles of Astyages had been foiled--and the empire of the Medes been doomed.</p><h2>Eyewitness to World War II: Unforgettable Stories and Photographs From History&#39;s Greatest Conflict</h2><p>The unforgettable story of World War II is told through the words of those who lived it&#x2014;America&#x2019;s greatest generation&#x2014;both on the battlefield and the home front.

Neither volume significantly overlaps with past books on Kley, as nearly none of these drawings have been collected and reprinted since their original publication a century or more ago. Both volumes also provide groundbreaking scholarship on Kley's life and work by German art historian Alexander Kunkel--whose recent research is presented in these volumes for the first time in English--along with incisive appreciations by contemporary artists Michael Wm. Kaluta and Jesse Hamm. </p><p><i>Volume One</i> focuses on Kley's ink drawings, and reprints for the first time a substantial selection of his illustration work for children's books and adult genre fiction, a side of Kley's career previously unexplored in other collections. This volume also includes a wide sampling of Kley's cartoons and magazine work, with newly collected examples taken directly from a variety of rare sources such as "Jugend," "Simplicissimus," and the historic "Der Orchideengarten" (the world's first fantasy fiction magazine). In all, more than 300 Kley illustrations and cartoons fill this first volume. </p><p><i>Volume Two</i> also breaks new ground by being the first book to present a large number of Kley's paintings and preparatory drawings, some reproduced directly from the original art. These color works reveal a heretofore rarely glimpsed pool of talent, and expand on the subject matter traditionally associated with the artist by including examples of his landscapes and industrial paintings. This volume's preparatory drawings are culled from the Library of Congress? untapped Kley archive, and show the artist working out concepts for book illustrations, reworking ink drawings into color paintings, and doodling for his own amusement. Approximately 150 drawings, many in color, appear in this volume. </p><p>Both volumes represent an important advancement to the English-language scholarship on Heinrich Kley, and the abundance of art within should delight admirers of Kley, new and old alike.</p></p><p>Heinrich Kley (1863-1945) was born in Karlshure, Germany, where he eventually studied at the Karlsruhe School of Fine Arts under history painter Ferdinand Keller. He moved to Munich in 1909, where he succeeded in broadening his artistic and financial horizons and in building a body of work that has made a lasting impression to this day on all of those fortunate enough to have seen it.</p><h2>To Teach: The Journey of a Teacher</h2><p><p><em>To Teach</em> is the now-classic story of one teacher&#x2019;s odyssey into the ethical and intellectual heart of teaching. For almost two decades, it has inspired teachers across the country to follow their own paths, face their own challenges, and become the teachers they long to be. Since the second edition, there have been dramatic shifts to the educational landscape: the rise and fall of NCLB, major federal intervention in education, the Seattle and Louisville Supreme Court decisions, the unprecedented involvement of philanthropic organizations and big city mayors in school reform, the financial crisis, and much more.

He is not particularly wise or helpful; in fact, he&#39;s a lecherous, grumbling old geezer who gives advice such as &#34;When you arise in the morning, you should do last night&#39;s dirty dishes . . . then you should sing a simple melody (of your own choice) . . . then you should call somebody up (not me) . . . then go to the store . . . buy some asparagus.&#34; True to the collection&#39;s name and R. Crumb&#39;s reputation, the stories are sometimes sexually graphic (especially in the scenes with Devil Girl) and a bit on the violent side. Still, there&#39;s an innocent, upbeat quality to this comic reflection of America&#39;s most notoriously freewheeling decade.Born in Philadelphia, R. Crumb is the author of numerous comic works and one of the pioneers of underground comics and arguably one of the most famous cartoonists in history.

Catholics tend to think of them as <i>different</i> from the rest of us. They&#x2019;re cast in plaster or simpering on a holy card, performing miracles with superhero strength, or playing a harp in highest heaven. <br><br>Yet they are very near to us in every way. In this lively book, Scott Hahn dispels the false notions and urban legends people use to keep the saints at a safe distance. The truth is that Jesus Christ has united heaven and earth in a close communion. Drawing deeply from Scripture, Dr. Hahn shows that the hosts of heaven surround the earthly Church as a "great cloud of witnesses." The martyrs cry out from heaven&#x2019;s altar begging for justice on the earth. The prayers of the saints and angels rise to God, in the Book of Revelation, like the sweet aroma of incense.<br><br>Dr. Hahn tells the stories of several saints (and several angels too) in a way that&#x2019;s fresh and new. The saints are spiritual giants but with flesh-and-blood reality. They have strong, holy ambitions&#x2014;and powerful temptations and opposition that must be overcome. Their stories are amazing and yet familiar enough to motivate us to live more beautiful lives. In this telling of their story, the saints are neither otherworldly nor this-worldly. They exemplify the integrated life that every Christian is called to live.<br><br>Still, their lives are as different from one another as human lives can be. Dr. Hahn shows the heavenly Church in all its kaleidoscopic diversity&#x2014;from Moses to Mary, Augustine to Therese, and the first century to the last century.<br><br>Only saints will live in heaven. We need to be more like the saints if we want to live in heaven someday. Dr. Hahn shows us that our heavenly life can begin now. <br><br>It must.</p></p><p><p><b>SCOTT HAHN</b> holds the Fr.

The town's buildings--its hotels and shops and restaurants--are medieval or at least look the part. Look in any direction, and the green, rolling hills look like landscapes from the old masters. You'll find few cars on the cobblestone streets, but at any moment you could find yourself in a throng of brown-robed pedestrians.<br><br>It's the town of St. Francis, the town of St. Clare, and its inhabitants are proud of the fact. They strive to keep it credibly Franciscan for the hundreds of thousands of pilgrims and tourists who visit each year. It's also the town of lesser-known saints such as Agnes of Assisi (Clare's little sister) and Gabriel of the Sorrowful Virgin, the ancient St. Rufinus and the Benedictine hermit St. Vitalis.<br><br>And it is the town of myriad angels. The centuries-old fortification is called the Rocca San Angelo--Holy Angel Fortress. The gem of Assisi's many churches is the Basilica of St. Mary of the Angels, which houses St. Francis's own Portiuncula (Little Portion) chapel.<br><br>So many angels and saints, but so little time. We had made quick trips to Assisi--my wife, Kimberly, and I--but we wanted to walk its streets again, to make a pilgrimage more intentional and familiar. We advertised a tour and were to play host to more than a hundred fellow pilgrims from the United States.<br><br>We were eager, then, to believe the doctor when he told us that our seven-year-old, Joe, would be well enough to make the trip--even though our flight left just two weeks after his emergency appendectomy. Joe was mending, the doctor said, in an exemplary fashion, and there was no sign of infection or complications.<br><br>Joe, for his part, didn't feel he needed a doctor to pronounce him ready. Irrepressible, athletic, and gifted with the strongest constitution in the family, he was always up for an adventure. And Assisi, with its maze of hills and alleyways, forts and castles, promised him episodes straight out of storybooks and Butler's Lives of the Saints.<br><br>In Assisi Joe--and we--got more of an adventure than he dreamed, but a different sort of adventure.<br><br>The doctor's healthy prognosis was confirmed by Joe's movement on the flight to Rome, and then on the bus through the mountains to Assisi. My son's voyage had begun, and he was the explorer, the crusader, the true pilgrim. His worried parents, of course, were on the alert for any sign of strain, and occasionally we made the obligatory but pointless admonition for the seven-year-old to relax and get some rest.<br><br>Our first day was partial and included only a few of the sites associated with the lives of the local saints. Still, it was enough to earn the whole family--and even Joe--a good night's sleep when we hit the pillows back at the hotel.<br><br>The itinerary for our second day was full, and we set out early. But this day was definitely different. Within the first hour, I noticed that Joe was wincing and stopping. By the second hour, he was stopping to double over. At first, when I asked, he protested that everything was okay, and he denied having any pain more than a walking cramp. But soon it became apparent that he couldn't go on. Kimberly actually removed our toddler, David, from our stroller, and set Joe in David's place.<br><br>It was clear, though, that this wouldn't be enough, and we asked our tour guide to summon us a taxi so we could visit a doctor. Kimberly and I divided the duties: she would stay behind in the old town with the other children; I would accompany Joe to the hospital.<br>KNOW PAIN, KNOW GAIN<br><br>The taxi delivered Joe and me to an unassuming and unimpressive building: Ospedale di Assisi. It wasn't what I had hoped to see. It wasn't what I would expect to see at a comparable tourist destination in the United States. The outside appearance didn't leave me with a strong sense of confidence. What everyone loves about Assisi--its long lingering in the Middle Ages--was not what I wanted to find in its practice of medicine.<br><br>My worries were relieved, slightly, by the kind expressions of the people inside. Yet their greetings only added a new cause for concern, as it became clear that we shared few words in common beyond our simple greetings. They said their halting hellos and we our pathetically accented buon giornos; and then, with gestures and pidgin phrases, we set about trying to communicate about Joe's medical history and current symptoms.<br><br>My anxiety levels climbed higher, higher than the Rocca San Angelo that overlooked the town. Joe was, by this time, writhing in my arms as he sat awkwardly in my lap.<br><br>The people from reception ushered us back to the x-ray room, where the technician was also just arriving. Quite obviously one of the town's firemen, he arrived still wearing uniform overcoat and galoshes. He did his work as quickly as possible on equipment that looked, to my untrained eye, at least a couple of decades old.<br><br>We then continued our pilgrim way to an examining room, to await the dottore. It was a mercifully brief wait till we met the doctor. And, as if in answer to my urgent prayers, he spoke adequate English.<br><br>He looked at the chart as I explained the situation--Joe's appendectomy, his "exemplary" recovery, and then our crisis. He nodded, then gently touched a couple spots on Joe's abdomen before Joe cried out from the pain.<br><br>The doctor led me into the hallway and said the words I wanted to hear: "I think your son will be fine." With his limited English, he explained that the pain was now in a "safe" place. But if it should shift to the other side, Joe would need immediate surgery. "And that would be a serious problem, not only because we'd have to operate, but because we'd have to operate here." His tone seemed to indicate that here was not the best location for surgery.<br><br>We checked into the hospital for an overnight stay. Joe, who was ordinarily voracious, had no appetite for food. A boy who rarely complained, he was now reduced to moaning and crying into his pillow.<br><br>I tried to keep him amused, making small talk, and he tried now and then to focus on a handheld video game, but the pain consumed his attention and wrung my paternal heart. Around ten p.m. I asked him, "Where's the pain now? Is it still in the same place?" And he said, "No, it's on the other side." I asked him if he was sure about that, and he said he was.<br><br>Joe had not heard my conversation with the doctor, so he didn't know the import of his words. I excused myself and hurried down to the nurses' station, where I asked a nurse to contact the doctor. I took up a piece of paper and wrote the words, "Pain on other side. Danger."<br><br>I returned to the room and waited for the doctor. Joe was writhing in agony. I tried to calm him, and gradually his moans subsided into a whimper as he fell in and out of an exhausted sleep. Not knowing when help might arrive, I turned off the lights in the room and did the only thing left for me to do.<br><br>I dropped to my knees in the most desperate prayer, imploring God's help in the most general and inarticulate way.<br><br>And I was startled by a sudden sense of presence--a vivid sense.<br><br>God was with me in that room. If you had turned on the lights and I had seen him, I wouldn't have been surprised. God was close to me in my helplessness. I had the clear sense that he was asking me: What are you afraid of?<br><br>I was taken aback, and I responded frankly, though interiorly: Why would you even ask that? You know what I'm afraid of. I'm afraid of losing my son in surgery in a place that's not prepared to deal with this sort of problem. I love him, and I don't want him to die.<br><br>And just as clearly I sensed God's reply: Is that all?<br><br>I couldn't have imagined this. I couldn't have made this up. It seemed to me that the all-knowing, all-seeing, all-compassionate God was belittling my concerns. But as long as he was asking, I'd answer with both barrels: Well, no, that's not all. I'm also afraid what will happen to my wife, his mother. It would shatter her.<br><br>Again the response came: Is that all?<br><br>So I kept going: No, it's not. He has siblings. And here we are on a pilgrimage, far from home and responsible for a hundred pilgrims. Am I supposed to abandon them?<br><br>And is that all?<br><br>It began to dawn on me that my fears that were on the surface--and that seemed obvious to me--were linked to deeper fears, more subtle fears that had to do with my family life, my personal life, my professional life, fears of failure, fears of loss, fears of humiliation. In an instant, my life appeared before me as a web of fears, cares, concerns, anxieties, and worries. Till that moment I'd never quite been aware of this.<br><br>But God had been. It became clear to me that God was not asking questions so that I could inform him of anything. He was asking so that I would have to formulate answers--and so he could show me how much my life was controlled by fear.<br><br>Into my mind came the first papal words of the man who was then the pope, Blessed John Paul II. He said to the world: "Be not afraid." He was echoing Jesus (Matthew 28:10) and so many angels (Luke 1:13, 2:10). And no one--not Jesus nor the angels nor Pope John Paul--ever said there was no reason to be afraid. They just told us to get over it, to get past the fear, and to accept the grace that God was extending to us through our trials.<br><br>It was then that Assisi lived up to its reputation for me. In an instant I realized that Joe and I were far from alone in the room. God was with me; but there with God were so many others. I knew the presence of the Blessed Virgin Mary, our guardian angels, and the saints whose footsteps I'd been following, Francis and Clare. There was Padre Pio, and St. Therese of the Child Jesus, and St. Thomas Aquinas, and St. Josemaria Escriva--all saints who had significantly influenced my spiritual and intellectual life. They were really there, in the presence of God. They were there because they truly cared about Joe and me, and Kimberly and the pilgrims, and they were interceding for all of us.<br><br>As never before, I knew the truth of the Scripture: "Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross" (Hebrews 12:1-2).<br>The saints, the great cloud of witnesses, were cheering us onward as we raced forward after Jesus our "pioneer," through our share in his cross.<br><br>The same chapter of the Letter to the Hebrews acknowledges the presence of "innumerable angels" with the saints, "the spirits of just men made perfect" (Hebrews 12:22-23); the angels, too, were with me in that room, praying with me, praying for my heart's intention: for Joe.<br><br>Please don't get me wrong. I'm not a man given to mystical flights, or visions, or locutions. My family and closest friends will testify that I'm not prone to euphoria. Nor do I think my experience was anything extraordinary. I believe I experienced, for a moment, a heightened sense of what is truly ordinary. This is the backdrop of our everyday life: The angels and saints are with us as witnesses, as friends, as family. We are never alone. We need never be afraid. This is a simple corollary of our salvation. It's a fact too easily forgotten.<br><br>"The Lord is at hand. Have no anxiety about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God" (Philippians 4:5-6).<br><br>As I let my fears be known, I grew more aware of the saints' presence. They were, in a sense, more present than I was--more awake, more alert, more alive in God. They were like older siblings who had come to the aid of a younger one who's injured. My prayer became a conversation that included all of them. And, again, if you had flipped on the light and I had seen their faces, I wouldn't have been surprised.<br><br>There came a moment when I thought I could pray like this all night--but I realized that that would be selfish, and it would leave me useless to everyone at the time of Joe's surgery. I knew I should get up off the floor and get some sleep.<br><br>That was when it occurred to me: for the last two hours and forty-five minutes Joe hadn't uttered a peep--no crying, no moaning, no writhing. He'd been sleeping peacefully the whole time.<br><br>I didn't sense that a miracle had happened. I just felt a certain peace, and I went to Our Lady, who had been there from the beginning, and I prayed a Rosary to close the night.<br>THE SCIENCE OF THE SAINTS<br><br>I woke around eight a.m. and noticed that Joe was still sleeping. I heard muffled voices in the hallway and recognized one as the doctor's. When he peeked in the doorway, I motioned for him to speak softly. He told me he had already put in a call to assemble a team for surgery.<br><br>I explained that the pain had shifted in the night, and that Joe was up late crying, but around midnight he stopped. I told him I had been on my knees praying at the time.<br><br>He smiled, indulgently but skeptically.<br><br>Suddenly Joe woke up, sat us, and said, "Buon giorno!" The night before he couldn't even sit up without help.<br><br>The doctor was visibly startled. "Buon giorno, Giuseppe," he said. "How are you feeling?"<br><br>Joe yawned and said, "Great." Still looking skeptical, the doctor lifted Joe's shirt and pressed on both sides.<br><br>Joe meanwhile told the doctor about how the pain had moved the night before, but then went away.<br><br>The doctor was incredulous and ordered tests. Over the next three hours, the nurses drew blood and passed it along to the lab.<br><br>Around midday, the doctor came back, scratching his head. "I'm not a religious man," he said to me. "I'm scientific. I don't believe in miracles. But when you practice medicine in Assisi, you encounter these things. Things happen that science can't explain."<br><br>And that, it occurs to me, is true science--what St. Edith Stein called "the science of the saints." And it is the subject of this book.</p><h2>B.P.R.D.: Plague of Frogs Volume 1</h2><p>In 2001, Hellboy quit the B.P.R.D., leaving Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman, and a bizarre roster of special agents to defend the world from any occult threats, and the growing menace of the frog army. <br>Mike Mignola and Dark Horse present the complete Plague of Frogs saga in four volumes, from Hollow Earth to King of Fear. This first book explores the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense after Hellboy's departure, cracks open the secrets of Abe Sapien's origin, and sets the war on frogs in motion.</p><p>Mike Mignola was born September 16, 1960 in Berkeley, California and grew up in nearby Oakland.

By that time, Charlie Flagg, the central character of this novel, was one of a dying breed of men who wrested their living from the harsh land of West Texas. The struggle made them fiercely independent, a trait personified in Charlie&#x2019;s persistence throughout the seven dry years, his refusal to accept defeat, his opposition to federal aid programs and their inevitable bureaucratic regulations, his determination to stay on the land he loves and respects even as he suffers with that land. Charlie is by no means the typical cowboy hero. Self-sufficient, courageous, with a strong sense of right and wrong, he is also old and overweight, a thoroughly believable human being who has trouble communicating with the wife who loyally struggles to keep life in its pattern, the son who has no feel for the land but yearns for the rodeo circuit, the Mexican family who has worked for him for years and whose help he can no longer afford. Although Charlie never loses his dignity and never quits, he does not win out in the end. When the drought breaks, it has lasted too long and he is too old.<br><br>There is no surprise ending to this story, no magical solution to the harsh realities of life in West Texas. The reading of this novel lies not in what happens next but in the unfolding depth of a strong character and the clear picture of a time and a place.</p><p>Elmer Kelton is the author of over thirty novels set in the West and the recipient of awards from the Texas Institute of Letters, the National Cowboy Hall of Fame, Western Writers of America, the Western Literature Association, and others.The Time It Never Rained<br>Chapter One&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>RIO SECO WAS TOO SMALL TO AFFORD A PROFESSIONAL manager for its one-room Chamber of Commerce. The part-time volunteer, elected because no one else wanted the job, made his living selling an independent brand of gasoline two cents under the majors though he bought it from the same tank truck that serviced half the stations in town. A man of wit, some people thought, he had erected a big red-and-white sign on the highway at the city limits:WELCOME TO RIO SECO HOME OF 3,000 FRIENDLY PEOPLE--AND THREE OLD CRANKS!Farther inside the city limits, half-hidden between a Ford billboard and one for Pepsi-Cola, he had placed another sign:THIS IS GOD'S COUNTRY DON'T DRIVE THROUGH IT LIKE HELLThis cattle, sheep, and farming town was much the same as fifty others dotted along the interminable east-west highways which speed traffic across the great monotonous stretches of western Texas ranch country. To an impatient motorist hunting a cooler place to light before dark, these dusty little towns are all cut from the same tiresome pattern and, despite the signboard, a long way from heaven.Like most of them, Rio Seco had old roots. It had been born out of necessity, a trading place for sprawling cow outfits, for scattered sheep camps and industrious German dryland farmers who had come west with their wagons, their plows, and a compulsive will to build something. The town long ago had made its growth and found its natural level. Now it held steady, gaining no ground but losing none. Oil companies had come and punched their holes and found them dry. They had gone again, leaving dreams of quick riches to drift away on the arid wind like the cotton-white clouds that promised rain and failed to deliver.Life still depended on two fundamentals: crops planted by the hand of man and grass planted by the hand of God.<i>Give us rain</i>, they said at Rio Seco, <i>and it makes no difference who is in the White House</i>.If one thing set the town apart, it was probably the trees--pale-green mesquites and massive, gnarled live oaks, rustling cottonwoods and shady pecans, watered by a hundred windmills whose towers stood tall above a timid skyline. Modern municipal mains provided purer water for drinking and cooking, but most of the older generation clung to wells for yards and gardens and trees. For a man who has often turned his face to the hot breath of drouth, the sight of a windmill tower--its big steel fan clanking patiently and pumping up water clear and cool--somehow reaches deep and touches something in his soul.The town had three cultures--Anglo, German, andMexican. The first two had largely merged through the years--beef and beans and apple strudel. The third remained unassimilated, except perhaps in Rio Seco's unhurried pace of living. Most of the Anglos were addicted to Mexican food, and most of the Mexicans loved football, but these were superficial things.Many of the older rock homes had a no-nonsense squared-off solidity the Germans had brought from their original settlements in the Pedernales River section of the hill country. Across the railroad tracks, beyond roads dusty from passage of livestock trucks on their way to the shipping pens, lay the Mexican part of town--ageless adobes and small frame shacks, and a fair number of modern GI houses built since the war. The old and the new stood side by side in sharp contrast: a wrinkled, ancient Mexican working up adobe bricks out of straw and mud in a barefoot method known to the fathers of his grandfathers, while next door a three-man crew with electric saws cut raw lumber for a new frame house. Two small brown-faced boys sat on a forebearing Mexican burro, their black eyes alive with curiosity as they watched an older brother tuning the motor of a hotrod.For the ranchman, business centered around Emmett Rodale's old stone bank and Jim Sweet's feedstore-wool warehouse, a long, cool, cavernous building of concrete tile. There in round, well-packed jute bags wedged between steel poles and stacked nearly to the high ceiling lay stored the gray-white fleeces that for three generations had been a cornerstone of Rio Seco's economy.For the farmer, business focused on the same bank, the cotton gin and a small grain elevator with twin steel tubes that stood taller than anything else in town except the sun-catching silver water tower emblazoned with crudely painted red letters: SRS '51.In the second floor of the rock-fronted courthouse was a room which in recent years had emerged as another important economic fact of life: the county office of the federal PMA. Next to rain, perhaps, it had become the <i>most</i>important fact. Here the man of the land came to declare his crop acreage, his past year's plantings. Here he was told how much land he would be allowed to seed in cotton, in grain sorghums, in whatever other crops might be under federal control. Here he came for price support and to receive checks to help him pay for terraces and water-spreading, for water wells and surface tanks, for battling back the prickly pear and thorny mesquite.Here he sold his freedom bit by bit, and was paid for it on the installment plan.March Nicholson, the county PMA officer, stood at the open window, looking down on the freshly mowed courthouse lawn, the buried sprinkler system showering green bermuda grass dotted by patches of dying winter rye. It always irritated him the way people parked haphazardly around the courthouse curb, ignoring the town ordinances, if indeed there were any. Across the street under a live-oak tree, half blocking the driveway to Nicholson's rented home, stood a pickup truck with a Hereford cow tied in the sideboarded bed and a saddled horse in an open-topped trailer hitched behind it. Horse droppings had tumbled over the tailgate and onto the ground; Nicholson would have to use his shovel tonight. He cursed under his breath. In the back of another pickup waited two Border Collie sheepdogs, resting but alert-eyed, watching a farmer pull up in a bobtail truck with two big tractor tires and several sacks of planting seed.Nicholson's baleful eye was pulled away from the horse droppings by a brush-scarred green pickup pulling into an open parking space."Well, I'll be damned. I wish you'd look who's come to the meeting."His district supervisor pushed to his feet from a chair in the courtroom's jury box where he had slouched to read a copy of the morning San Angelo paper. He watched a heavy, graying ranchman step out of the pickup and limp up the concrete sidewalk toward the front steps of the courthouse. He saw nothing which made that man lookdifferent from the couple of dozen stockmen and farmers already gossiping in the courtroom."I don't know him. Is he somebody special?""He's Charlie Flagg."The name meant nothing to the supervisor. "One of the rich ones?" he guessed. In this part of the country it was often hard to tell the rich man from the poor one by looking at him. The rich man was as likely to be wearing patched trousers and runover boots as the most destitute Mexican cowboy in town. One could not afford to put up a front and the other did not have to.Nicholson shook his head. "No, not rich. Charlie Flagg is one of those operators in the middle ground ... smaller than a lot of them. You've seen that sign on the edge of town, the one about the three old cranks? Charlie Flagg is Crank Number One."The supervisor watched the ranchman pause on the front steps to swap howdies with a deputy sheriff. The deputy, who probably did not swing a leg across a horse's back twice a year, was dressed in a neatly tailored Western shirt and tight-legged cowboy pants, shiny high-heeled boots and a nicely creased Stetson hat. The rancher, probably on horseback half his waking hours, wore a nondescript straw hat beaten badly out of shape and a pair of old black boots, his baggy khaki trousers stuffed carelessly into their tops. There was a lesson in this somewhere, the supervisor thought; someday he was going to reason it out."Gives you trouble, does he, March?""No trouble ... or anything else. Never sticks his hard head into my office. He's one of those old mosshorns who thinks he made it all by himself and he doesn't need anybody. I've tried to get him to go into some of our programs. You ought to hear him snort. Says the government didn't help him when he was getting started and he doesn't need it now.""Then I'd simply forget about him if I were you. Some people you can't change; you just have to outlive them.""Charlie Flagg is too contrary to die; he'll outlive us all."Nicholson's face twisted as he looked at the men who sat in little groups scattered around the big courtroom, talking weather and crops and prices. He had sent out five hundred postcards announcing the meeting; this looked like about all the crowd he was going to get."It's frustrating," he complained. "A man devotes his life to service, and this is the response they give him. Sometimes I wish I was selling cars in San Antonio."The supervisor said, "The rest'll come in when it's time to get their checks."Nicholson walked down the aisle and out into the hallway to see if there were any laggards. He saw Charlie Flagg come up the steps, laboring a little because of a slightly game leg. Part of a postcard stuck out of one shirt pocket. Nicholson shoved his hand forward. "Mister Flagg, when I sent you that card I had no hope you would actually come to the meeting."Flagg gripped Nicholson's hand hard enough to bring a stab of pain, but he looked puzzled. "Meetin'? What meetin'?""The meeting to explain the changes in the farm program."Flagg shrugged his heavy shoulders. "They change the farm program the way I change socks. Before you can get your meetin' over with, they'll be callin' you from Washington to tell you it's all different."Nicholson sagged a little. "You didn't come for the meeting, then?"Flagg shook his head. "I come up huntin' the judge. They sent me a call for jury duty and I got a shearin' crew comin' tomorrow. Court can wait, but a shearin' crew won't."Nicholson saw that the postcard in Flagg's pocket was not the one he had mailed. "Well, I still say you'll be in to see me someday, Mister Flagg."Flagg's gaze was steady and without compromise. "What I can't do for myself, I'll do without."A short, stocky ranchman came up the stairs in time to catch the last of it. He paused to spit a long stream of brown tobacco juice at a hallway cuspidor, getting most of it in. "You're preachin' again, Charlie," he grinned, "and this ain't even church."Charlie Flagg turned, a little embarrassed. "Hello, Rounder. I didn't go to preach, but he asked me and I told him."Rounder Pike laid a rough hand on Flagg's shoulder. "You're fartin' against the wind, Charlie. We've got used to government money like a kid gets used to candy. Most people wouldn't quit takin' it now. Them as did would go right on payin' the same old taxes and not get nothin' back. We're like a woman that's been talked into a little taste of sin and found out she likes it. You'd just as well join the crowd. You're payin' the freight anyway.""Never."<i>"Never</i> is an awful long time." Pike gripped Flagg's shoulder, then walked on into the courtroom.Nicholson motioned toward the door. "There's plenty of room, Mister Flagg."Flagg started to turn away. "You'll find, Mister Nicholson, that ranchers are contrary people. And <i>old</i> ranchers are <i>awful</i> contrary." He limped down the hall toward the office of the county judge.Nicholson's supervisor had come out into the hallway to listen. He said, "One of those <i>rugged individualists,</i> isn't he?""Someday he'll just be a <i>ragged</i> individualist. He's standing still while time goes on by. But he'll be in to see me one of these days. He'll come in like all the rest."The supervisor frowned, watching the rancher go through an open door. "Somehow, I hope he never does."Nicholson's eyebrows went up.The supervisor said, "He's gone out of style, but theworld will be a poorer place when it loses the last of his kind.""You sympathize with him?""I pity him, a little. A man can get awfully lonesome standing out there all by himself."Copyright � 1973, 1984 by Elmer Kelton</p><h2>How to Get Out of Debt, Stay Out of Debt, and Live Prosperously*: Based on the Proven Principles and Techniques of Debtors Anonymous</h2><p><b>A simple, proven-effective formula for freeing yourself from debt&#x2014;and staying that way � Revised and updated, with a new Preface by the author</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>&#x201c;A must read for anyone wanting to get their head above water.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br> THE CLASSIC GUIDE, REVISED WITH UP-TO-THE-MINUTE INFORMATION<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>OUT OF THE RED</b><br> � Do this month&#x2019;s bills pile up before you&#x2019;ve paid last month&#x2019;s?<br> � Do you regularly receive past-due notices?<br> � Do you get letters threatening legal action if immediate payment is not made?<br> � Do the total amounts of your revolving charge accounts keep rising?<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>INTO THE BLACK</b><br> Whether you are currently in debt or fear you&#x2019;re falling into debt, you are not alone.

It was her first job with Matthew, her first bomb built especially for him. It would work, she knew it would, but deep down she had doubts, and hated it. She shook her head, knowing she'd produce a lovely explosion for him as she watched for Ian and his boys. The Firth of Forth was to her left, salt and brine mingling with the sharp scent of unrefined oil.<br><br>The darkness was broken only by the lights of the refinery, always running, even after the sun went down. The lighted metal poles mingled with security lamps and boom lights to halo the bobbing headlamps on the workers' helmets. The whole scene looked fantastical, a stage setting in an artificial gloom.<br><br>Vanessa looked at her watch. Five minutes to go. Ian was placing the bomb, and at his signal she should be the one to detonate it, but not this time. Matthew told her he was going to be the one to blow up the night sky.<br><br>Well, let him, if it gave him a kick. Or was it this particular refinery? Even though it was her job, she smiled at him as she handed over the trigger. It didn't matter, she knew her baby would work just fine.<br><br>Vanessa didn't yet understand him, but it was early days. She recognized his genius, his facility with ideas and each step they had to consider before moving ahead with his selected target. She also knew his amazing bomb wasn't yet perfected. If it was, surely he'd want to test it.<br><br>She looked at her watch again, said aloud to Matthew, "Where is Ian? He should be out by now. The security guard will circle back around in thirty seconds. He's cutting it too close."<br><br>Matthew Spenser, the Bishop, a moniker he'd been given by Ian a long time before, because, as Ian had explained to her, he'd learned that Matthew existed in a master's chess realm that was always ten moves ahead of everyone else, and so didn't he deserve the name? Why not King? she wondered, but didn't say anything. Matthew was tall, lean, and hyper, sharp as a poised knife, he liked to think. She felt the excitement coming off him in waves. He was about to score another win.<br><br>He said to Vanessa, "Ian's never failed me. He'll be along. He knows what he's doing."<br><br>Three minutes now. They couldn't use comms; radio frequencies could set off the bomb.<br><br>She saw movement by the perimeter, and her adrenaline spiked. No, it wasn't Ian. Where was he? She felt gut-wrenching fear that something had gone wrong, that he'd been caught. Or, almost as bad, that she'd messed up and the bomb was somehow defective. Or, at the very worst, she'd been found out. No, she had to calm herself. Her beautiful, powerful Semtex bomb would work and Ian was a master at this; he'd get it set in place and get himself and their guys out of the plant. All would go well.<br><br>She let out her breath. Since her prints were all over the bomb and Ian always wore gloves, the message would be clear and received. Her bosses would know it was her group who'd blown up Grangemouth.<br><br>Two minutes.<br><br>Matthew squeezed her arm, gave her a quick smile. "Your first bomb for me." She could only nod. He felt to her like he was ready to jump out of his skin, or his brain, maybe both, but she felt it, too, this manic brew of emotions that roared through both of them. She wondered if in the aftermath of the explosion he would try to get her into bed, to celebrate scoring this victory by scoring her. She'd hold him off, waiting, waiting, trying to judge if she would have to go the sex route to find out what she needed to know.<br><br>She took one last look at her watch. "We're out of time."<br><br>"Vanessa, look there."<br><br>Ian was running across the field toward them, his now-empty backpack flying like wings behind him, a crazy smile stretched across his face, three of their men behind him.<br><br>She put in her earplugs.<br><br>Matthew was watching her as he stuffed in his own earplugs. Then, without a word, he grinned down at her and handed her back the trigger with a flourish. "Have at it, Vanessa, have at it."<br><br>Why had he changed his mind? What did it prove? Had he planned to see if she'd lose her nerve, not be able to detonate the bomb? Well, it hardly mattered.<br><br>Vanessa looked up at him as she depressed the trigger, a button on her cell phone.<br><br>A fraction of a second later, she felt the explosion. It started in the soles of her feet, pounded up her legs as the ground began to shake and an earsplitting roar tore through the silence. The night sky became day.<br><br>The concussion knocked both of them backward. They landed hard, their breath knocked out of them. When Vanessa managed to pull air into her lungs, she scrambled to her hands and knees, facing the heat of the blaze raging in the refinery. It looked like a bonfire on steroids, much stronger than she'd expected. She saw Ian and his men crouched down behind distant refinery trucks, did a quick head count. Everyone was accounted for.<br><br>So fast, all of it, so fast. The bomb had done its job, and she'd been its builder. She'd proven herself, established herself once and for all. Now she would be in with Matthew Spenser; now he had to accept her into his inner circle. After all, she was the one who'd engineered this marvel for him, and he would know there were more marvels to come. He had to trust her now.<br><br>He was screaming something at her, his voice wild, filled with alarm.<br><br>She couldn't hear him, pulled out her earplugs, but it didn't help much. The bomb's concussion had deafened her.<br><br>Then he leaped on her, rolling on top of her, slapping at her head.<br><br>"Your hair is on fire!"<br><br>Her hair was on fire? She knew she should be panicked, she should freak out, but she didn't move, and let him worry about it. Matthew jerked off his shirt and smothered her head in it.<br><br>When he pulled his shirt off her head, he stared down at her. "It's only the ends of your hair. Are you all right?"<br><br>She stared up at him, smelling her burned hair, listening to the roaring flames, and she started to laugh. She rolled away from him and dropped her singed head to the scrubby, ancient land and laughed and laughed.<br><br>Matthew lay beside her, panting, watching her. He rolled up on one arm, raised his hand and fingered the ends of her burned hair. "Vanessa, are you all right?"<br><br>"Oh, yes, I'm perfect," and she laughed again.<br><br>Ian, his dark hair coated in ash, his men behind him, appeared to their left. "What a blast that was, Van! Wasn't expecting it to roar like a dragon. What are you two waiting for? It's time to go. Coppers will be here in a flash. Van, what'd you do to your hair? I told you never to stand so close, and look what you've done."<br><br>Vanessa stood, ran a hand over the crispy ends of her hair, brushed the dirt from her jeans. She looked at the two men-one dark, one light, both crazy like foxes, both grinning at her.<br><br>"Satisfied, Mr. Spenser?"<br><br>Matthew rose slowly, wiped off his hands on his jeans as she had, and smiled down at her. "Oh, yes," he said, his voice filled with pleasure. "I'm more than satisfied." And he stared down at her, at her mouth, his eyes hot and manic.<br><br>Monday<br><br>11 p.m.-4 a.m.<br><br>2<br><br>Knight to f6<br><br>Bayonne, New Jersey<br><br>Present<br><br>Monday Evening<br><br>FBI Special Agent Michaela Caine drove the black Crown Vic with one hand, tucked a hank of loose hair back into her ponytail with the other, then shoved up her glasses.<br><br>It was late and she was tired, ready to go home and crash. But no chance, since they'd gotten a credible tip off the hotline. She looked over at her partner, Special Agent Nicholas Drummond, tapping on a laptop balanced on his knees, doing a background check on their tipster.<br><br>She said, "I'm praying with all my might we're not on a wild-goose chase and this guy isn't a thrill chaser."<br><br>Nicholas looked up. "I'm inclined to think he isn't. Ben said the man was convinced he had information on COE, and a possible bombing. At this point, I'm willing to listen to anyone, even if it means missing one of Nigel's dinners. He called me earlier, said it was prime rib."<br><br>Mike laughed. "Oh, my, that sounds even better than the scrumptious three-day-old chicken salad sandwich I was planning to have at home." She paused, then sighed. "We've been working this case for two weeks now, Nicholas, and gotten nowhere. I hate that. Several oil refineries out west and no leads. I only wish we could keep the frequent-flier miles earned from flying all over the country. And what do we have? This group's mission statement, over and over, the same thing: No more oil from terrorist countries or you will pay the price.<br><br>"And now, out of nowhere, this guy pops up in our own backyard with information on COE? On a possible bombing? Do you really think this Hodges character is for real?"<br><br>He looked over at her. "My gut is starting to agree with my brain and say yes. You know what else? I think it's also about time that we have our turn at bat."<br><br>Baseball metaphor from a Brit? No, he probably meant cricket. Were you at bat in cricket? She didn't know. She grinned. Either way, he was right, it was their turn, and if Hodges was for real, it was possible they'd have a chance for a home run.<br><br>Nicholas looked back at his laptop. "Mr. Hodges appears solid, an accountant for a local Bayonne engineering firm. His wife died three years ago, breast cancer."<br><br>She took a left into an older residential neighborhood, thick with trees and small, well-manicured lawns. Mr. Richard Hodges's house was on a quiet dead-end cul-de-sac that backed up to the Hudson River. To Nicholas, the block looked like any other older development in a small eastern American town-thirty-year-old single-story houses, comfortably settled in with their neighbors. Amazing how quiet it was, considering its proximity to Manhattan. He supposed the lapping water dampened the sound.<br><br>They saw the curtains twitch.<br><br>Nicholas closed his laptop. "I see we're expected."<br><br>Mike turned off the engine. "Okay, I'm thinking positively. I'm up at bat and Mr. Hodges is going to give me a perfect pitch."<br><br>The door opened before they had a chance to ring the bell. A man dressed in jeans and a white polo shirt waved them in and closed the door quietly behind them, as if he didn't want to wake someone. A habit from when his wife was ill?<br><br>The interior of Mr. Hodges's house was neat, looked clean, but it smelled musty, somehow sterile, and Mike doubted there'd been another woman living here since his wife's death. She didn't see any photos or knickknacks on any surface, only piles of newspapers and newsmagazines. The house, she realized, was now only a place where a lonely man lived off his memories.<br><br>"Mr. Hodges? I'm Agent Caine, and this is Agent Drummond. We were told you have some information about the terrorist group known as Celebrants of Earth, or COE, and a possible bombing."<br><br>Hodges was a smallish man with a bald spot and a heavy five-o'clock shadow. He looked solid, calm, no indication that he was an alarmist or a wild-hair. Maybe they had finally caught their break. She smelled bacon and toast, a single man's dinner. She felt a punch of pain for him.<br><br>"It's nice to meet you," he said. "Thank you for coming. Shall we sit? Can I get you coffee? I have some already brewed."<br><br>"We wouldn't say no to a cup, sir. Thank you."<br><br>He gestured toward the kitchen.<br><br>Mike and Nicholas took a seat at an ancient table with one leg shorter than the others, held steady with a pile of magazines. Moments later, they both had mugs of coffee and a plate of chocolate-mint Girl Scout Cookies. Nicholas took one to be polite; they'd been floating around the office for the past few weeks and tasted like wax to him.<br><br>Nicholas sipped his coffee, then set the cup on the table. "So, Mr. Hodges, tell us what you know."<br><br>Hodges blinked at him. "You're British? I didn't know people from England could be in the FBI. Are you some sort of special case?"<br><br>Mike nodded, grinning. "Yes, sir, he is indeed a special case."<br><br>Nicholas sat forward. "My mother was American. The story, sir, please."<br><br>Mr. Hodges nodded. "I was at the Dominion Bar tonight, having a drink after work. There was a man there-I don't know his name, but I've seen him around before. He's works at the Bayway Refinery-doing what, exactly, I don't know. He'd obviously been drinking a while, looked pretty drunk to me, and I wondered why the bartender, that's the owner, May Anne, hadn't cut him off. He was shooting his mouth off, you know the kind of person, they get loud when they've had too much to drink and, well, lose all sense. I heard him tell his friend he was celebrating. He'd gotten a big payoff, a lot of money, and more to come, and he was going to retire and move to an island somewhere and have women in bikinis wait on him, and not take his wife and whiny kids with him.<br><br>"I thought that was a pretty crappy thing to say-I lost my Miriam three years ago and I miss her every day-and I didn't want to listen to him, so I tried to tune him out. But he was sitting in the booth directly behind my stool, and I couldn't help but hear. His friend asked where the money came from, and he shushed him and lowered his voice like drunks do, whispered real loud that he couldn't tell, it was top secret. But something really big was going to go down, like what had happened to that oil refinery in Scotland a few months ago-Grangemouth, he said.<br><br>"His friend asked if he was breaking the law, and he started to laugh, sounded like a hyena, so drunk he couldn't keep it together. I paid for my drinks and left, but all the way home I couldn't help thinking about what he said. I knew this group COE claimed responsibility for the Scotland refinery bombing, they'd sent their statement to the news media, and it's the same as the one they always use here in the U.S. And like I said, I knew this drunk guy worked at Bayway Refinery. That's why I called your FBI tip line. Thank you for taking me seriously. Do you think this is a real threat?"</p><h2>Ceremonies of the Liturgical Year: According to the Modern Roman Rite</h2><p>The liturgy of the Catholic Church is the action by which Jesus Christ unites the members of the Church in glorifying God. It makes people holy through words, music, action and signs. The Eucharist is intended to be the most powerful means of union with our God, with the saints in heaven and with each other, and is to be a foretaste of the praise of God given in joy by the saints in heaven. As we move through the whole of the year, the Church is united with the mysteries of Christ's earthly life so as to come closer to her Lord and Saviour.<p>Monsignor Peter Elliott provides scholarship and many years' experience and love of the liturgy. His previous work&nbsp;<i>Ceremonies of the Modern Roman Rite</i>&nbsp;has helped many people to celebrate our liturgy with attention and devotion. This present work is a guide to the most important moments of the Church year from Advent and Christmas to Holy Week, Corpus Christi and to the Solemnity of Christ the King. His book has been a long-awaited guide to those who wish to celebrate the events of the Church year with dignity, devotion, and deep faith.</p></p><p><b>Msgr. Peter J. Elliott</b>, a priest of the Archdiocese of Melbourne, works in the Vatican.

The rubrics of the Roman Rite are not self-explaining, but with Elliot's work safely in reach, a generation of liturgists raised without a rich training in tradition can confidently approach the Ritual and be more respectful of the faithful's fundamental right to sound worship."<br><b>&#x2014; Dr. Edward Peters</b>, Institute for Pastoral Theology, Ave Maria University</p><h2>IB Chemistry Study Guide: 2014 Edition: Oxford IB Diploma Program</h2><p>This comprehensive Study Guide reinforces all the key concepts for the 2014 syllabus, ensuring students develop a clear understanding of all the crucial topics at SL and HL.

DICK (1928&#x2013;1982) published 36 science-fiction novels and 121 short stories in which he explored the essence of what makes man human and the dangers of centralized power. Toward the end of his life, his work turned to deeply personal, metaphysical questions concerning the nature of God. Eleven novels and short stories have been adapted to film, notably, <i>Blade Runner</i> (based on <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>), <i>Total Recall</i>, <i>Minority Report</i>, and <i>A Scanner Darkly</i>. The recipient of critical acclaim and numerous awards throughout his career, Dick was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2005, and in 2007 the Library of America published a selection of his novels in three volumes.

It served as a basis for future muckraking journalism by exposing the slums to New York City's upper and middle class.<br> <i>How The Other Half Lives</i> quickly became a landmark in the annals of social reform. Riis documented the filth, disease, exploitation, and overcrowding that characterized the experience of more than one million immigrants. He helped push tenement reform to the front of New York's political agenda, and prompted then-Police Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt to close down the police-run poor houses. Roosevelt later called Riis "the most useful citizen of New York".<br> Riis's idea inspired Jack London to write a similar expos� on London's East End, called <i>People of the Abyss</i>.</p><p>In How The Other Half Lives New Yorkers read with horror that three-quarters of the residents of their city were housed in tenements and that in those tenements rents were substantially higher than in better sections of the city. In his book Riis gave a full and detailed picture of what life in those slums was like, how the slums were created, how and why they remained as they were, who was forced to live there, and offered suggestions for easing the lot of the poor.<b>DAVID LEVIATIN</b> (Ph.D., Harvard) has taught American studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, the University of Rhode Island, and Charles University in Prague.

Koala Lou is loved by everyone, but it is her mother who loves her most of all. She often tells her daughter, "Koala Lou, I DO love you." As the family grows and her mother gets busier, Koala Lou yearns to hear those words again. She sets out to win the Bush Olympics as a way to gain her mother's attention. Lofts's colored-pencil drawings portray the Australian flora and fauna beautifully, including a few of the more exotic species. In Night Noises , elderly Lilly Laceby lives with her fat old dog Butch Aggie. While Lily dozes in front of the fire, Butch Aggie becomes increasingly concerned by the sounds of cars, voices, knocking and shouts. At last, Lily finally wakes up to answer the door, where a veritable mob waits to wish her a happy 90th birthday. Denton uses cartoon balloons and large letters to show the simultaneous action. Both of Fox's books send out positive messages to children about the wonders of being human: Koala Lou celebrates the eternal love of a mother for her child without the sentimentality of Robert Munsch's Love You Forever , and Night Noises lovingly bridges the generation gap.

It was the kind of office designed to make you feel like you didn't matter: a whole apartment could have slipped into the space between the outer doors and the wall of Omas's personal office. Ben almost expected to see tangled balls of misura vine rolling across the spotless pale blue carpet, driven by a distant wind. He couldn't see the point of all that empty space.<br><br>But the Senate building had been occupied and changed out of all recognition by the Yuuzhan Vong, Jacen said. Architects, designers and an army of construction droids had taken years to wipe away all traces of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion and restore the building to the way it had been. Ben tried to listen in the Force for the echoes of the aliens and their weird living technology, and thought he heard unrecognizable sounds. He shuddered and tried to occupy himself with the holozines stacked on the low greelwood table.<br><br>The 'zines were all very dull current affairs weeklies and political analysis, and one of them displayed an image of Jacen. Ben picked it up and activated it, smiling at the next image of a rotating Centerpoint Station, which didn't look quite so good in real life since he had helped sabotage it.<br><br><i>It's good to feel part of something important.<br><br></i>The holoreport featured clips of Corellian news of the raid on Centerpoint, but it didn't mention Ben, and he wasn't sure if that upset him or not. Some recognition would have been nice; but the Corellian sources that were quoted were pretty rude about Jacen, calling him a traitor and a terrorist. The reporter's voice seemed to fill the room even though the volume was set to minimum and the carpet and tapestries on the walls muffled the sound.<br><br>The report wasn&#x2019;t very kind about Uncle Han, either. A middle-aged man Ben didn&#x2019;t recognize was telling the reporter what he thought. &#x201c;So he calls himself a Corellian. But forget that bloodstripe on his uniform pants &#x2013; it might as well be a big yellow streak down his back, because Han Solo is just a Galactic Alliance puppet. He&#x2019;s betrayed Corellia by sitting on his backside doing whatever his Alliance buddies tell him to. And his son&#x2019;s just the same.&#x201d; <br><br> Jacen seemed embarrassed. Maybe he was more upset for his dad. Ben would have been.<br><br>"You should use an ear-piece to listen to those privately," said Jacen. <br><br>"But you're famous." Ben offered him the holozine. "Want to see?"<br><br>Jacen raised one eyebrow and seemed more worried about his meeting with Chief Omas. "Fine, but I could do without Thrackan Sal-Solo using me to humiliate my father in front of Corellia. You realize he gave all this information to the media, don't you?"<br><br>"Yeah, of course I do. But if we're not ashamed of it, why does it matter? We did the right thing for the Galactic Alliance. Centerpoint Station was a threat to everyone."<br><br>Jacen turned his head very slowly with that half-smile that Ben had learned meant he was impressed. "But a lot of worlds are taking Corellia's side now. So do you think those stories do any harm or not?"<br><br>Ben could always spot a test now. He knew he had to say what he believed: there was no point trying to be too clever. He wanted to learn from Jacen so badly that it burned him up. "Some worlds will always go against the Alliance anyway. So we might as well let the people on our side know we're taking action. Makes them feel safer."<br><br>Jacen nodded approvingly and Ben felt a little Force touch somewhere in his mind as if Jacen were patting him on the head. "That's very perceptive. I think you're right."<br><br>"Everyone will know <i>you're</i> doing your best to stop a war, anyway." Ben put the holozine back on the table and glanced at the rest of the titles. "There seem to be more pictures of you than anyone."<br><br>Jacen's smile faded for a moment and he glanced towards the doors of Omas's office, looking as if he was willing the head of the Galactic Alliance to finish his meeting and come out. Ben began to pick up what had caught Jacen's attention: there was a definite sense of conflict, of people arguing, and it was almost as clear as hearing it if you knew how to listen in the Force. Ben did now. Jacen was a good teacher.<br><br>Ben concentrated on Jacen's face. He looked a lot older lately. Sometimes he looked almost as old as Dad. "What's happening?" <br><br>"Heavyweight politics," said Jacen, barely audible. <br><br>He put his fingers almost to his lips, a very discreet gesture; it wasn't obvious to anyone else &#x2013; <i>anyone else</i> in this case being only the aide at the desk outside Omas's grand double doors &#x2013; but Ben took the hint. <i>Be quiet.<br></i><br>He was suddenly worried about letting Jacen down. Chief Omas wasn't a stranger; the man knew his father, and Ben had been brought to meet him at a state celebration -- pretty much all Ben remembered of that affair was feeling very small in a sea of tall people having conversations he didn't understand. But Ben wanted to be seen as Jacen's apprentice, not as Luke Skywalker's son, the <i>heir to the dynasty</i> as one of the guests had called him. It was hard being the son of two Jedi Masters who everyone referred to as "legends". Ben had lost count of the times he had felt invisible.<br> <br>"Chief Omas won't keep you, Jedi Solo," said the aide, tilting her head slightly towards the closed doors of Omas's office itself. "He's with Admiral Niathal at the moment."<br><br><i>I'm invisible again,</i> thought Ben.<br><br>He composed himself and sat down with his hands folded in his lap, a mirror of Jacen's own posture. He tried to count the number of different species of animal depicted on the huge tapestry that covered part of the wall opposite. What he had first thought was just a mass of random color was actually thousands of overlapping images of every animal he could imagine from across the galaxy &#x2013; across the whole Galactic Alliance. <br><br>Eventually the doors parted and Niathal strode out, radiating annoyance. Chief Omas appeared in the doorway behind her and forced a smile. "Ah, Jacen," he said. "I'm sorry to keep you. Won't you come in? And Ben. I'm glad you could make it, too."<br><br>Niathal glanced at Jacen as if she didn't recognize him. He acknowledged her with a slight bow of his head. <br><br>"Admiral," he smiled. "A pleasure to see you."<br><br>Niathal turned a little more to the side, the equivalent of a very frank stare for a Mon Calamari, a species with side-set eyes, and scrutinized both of them. "You did a very fine job at Centerpoint Station, sir. And you, young man."<br><br><i>My name's Ben.</i> But he had learned a little diplomacy now. "Thank you, ma'am."<br><br>Omas beckoned Jacen forward and Ben followed meekly. Omas did <i>not</i> make the tired comment that Ben had grown since he'd last seen him, nor did he look past him when he was talking to Jacen. The Chief met his eyes. It was both unsettling and exciting to be treated as an adult; Ben concentrated hard on what was being said.<br><br>Omas sat behind his desk rather than in the chair opposite them, as if he were taking cover. "So what brings you here, Jacen?" <br><br>"I have a proposal."<br><br>"Go ahead."<br><br>"Crippling Centerpoint Station only bought us time with Corellia. We might have a few months at most before it's operational again, and then we're back where we began but with a much more aggrieved Corellia that's gathering more support."<br><br>"Is this an extrapolation from what you see in the Force, Jacen?" <br><br>"No, it's just obvious to the point of inevitability."<br><br>Ben felt Omas teeter on the edge of reacting. It was as if the two men were having an argument without any of sign of it in their words or their voices. <br><br>"Go on," said Omas. <br><br>"Now is the only time we'll have for pre-emptive action, before any real opposition to the Galactic Alliance has chance to organize. Corellia, Commenor and Chasin need complete dissuasion, very <i>public</i> dissuasion to make a point to other governments about the need for unity &#x2013; and a complete neutralization of their capacity to fight a war. The destruction of their shipyards."<br><br>Ben was glad Jacen had said <i>destruction.</i> It was the first clue he'd had of what dissuasion actually meant.<br><br> "This," said Omas slowly, "is not unlike another conversation I've just had." <br><br>The way he said <i>conversation</i> made it clear what he'd been arguing about with Niathal. So she wanted to take action, exactly as Jacen did. "We've slapped Corellia and made a martyr to a cause," said Jacen. "An <i>armed</i> martyr to an <i>armed</i> cause."<br><br>"But Corellia has seen what we're made of, and that'll make them think twice."<br><br>"And we've now seen what <i>they're</i> made of," said Jacen. "And I have thought twice. If you give me command of a battle group, I can destroy the main shipyards and put an end to this now. If Corellia can be brought to heel, it sends the message that no single planet is bigger than the Alliance."<br><br>"You're asking me to declare war, Jacen, and that's something I'd never get Senate backing to do. And I know where the Jedi Council stands on this."<br><br>"War's coming anyway. If you draw a weapon on a Corellian, you'd better be prepared to use it. We drew it when we took out Centerpoint."<br><br>Omas was doing a good job of disguising his fear, but Ben could feel it. It didn't feel as if he was afraid of Jacen, but it was a vague and formless dread, as if events were drowning him. <br><br>"Talking of Corellians, would this attack not drive a huge wedge between you and your father?"<br><br>"It might well," said Jacen. "But I'm a Jedi, and it's precisely that kind of personal motivation we're trained to disregard."<br><br>"I'll take it under advisement."<br><br>"I'll take that as a <i>no.</i>" Jacen seemed perfectly calm. "I can tell you, with the certainty of the Force, that failing to stamp out dissent completely now will result in the deaths of billions in the coming years. We stand on a tipping point where we can choose chaos or order."<br><br>Omas meshed his fingers, hands on the desk, and stared at them both. "I agree we have a volatile situation here. Yes, this <i>is</i> a tipping point. But I think that escalating military action will be what tips us over into war, not what limits it. I <i>remember</i> the Empire, Jacen. I lived through it. And I dread seeing us become that kind of government." <br><br>Jacen just gave Omas a little nod of the head and stood up to leave. "Thank you for listening to my concerns."<br><br>They took the long walk back to the Senate lobby, down a broad corridor lined with blue and honey-gold marble inlay, and traveled down to the ground floor in a turbolift with walls so highly polished they were almost an amber mirror. <br><br>"Is politics always like that?" said Ben. "Why don't you both say what you mean?"<br><br>Jacen laughed. "Then it wouldn't be politics, would it?"<br><br>"And why does everyone keep saying, 'Oh, I remember the Empire...'? Uncle Han says it was bad, and so does Chief Omas. If they're <i>both</i> afraid of the same thing, why are they on opposite sides?"<br><br>Jacen seemed to find it very funny. Ben was embarrassed. <br><br>"I was only asking, Jacen."<br><br>"I'm not laughing at you. It's just very refreshing to hear someone cut through the nonsense and ask real questions." <br><br>"So what are you going to do next?"<br><br>Jacen checked his comlink. "Dad's still not responding. I need to clear the air with him. He&#x2019;s angry about Centerpoint."<br><br>"I meant about Chief Omas."<br><br>"We'll be patient. The solution will become clear &#x2013; to both of us." <br><br>"You and Omas."<br><br>"No, you and me."<br><br>Ben was delighted that Jacen seemed to take his opinions seriously. He was more determined than ever to conduct himself like a man, and not a boy. He knew now that he would never play again. <br><br>They crossed through the forest of pillars of the Senate lobby and emerged into the hazy sunshine that bathed the plaza. <br><br>Strung out in a ragged line, a group of around two hundred people had gathered to protest in front of the Senate building. Dozens of Coruscant Security Force officers had formed a loose line in front of the building, but it looked peaceful. The occasional shout of "Corellia's not your colony!" made it clear who the protesters were. Coruscant was home to beings from almost every planet in the galaxy, and even when war seemed to be coming, they stayed here. Ben found that...odd. Wars were about front lines and distant planets, not about people who looked a lot like him and who almost lived next door.<br><br>"Something tells me we'd better not stop and sign autographs," said Ben.<br><br>Jacen stopped to look back at the protest. "How many Corellians do you think live in Galactic City?" One of the beings in the crowd had projected a huge holo-image onto the face of the Senate building: it read CORELLIA HAS A RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE. "Five million? Five billion?"<br><br>"Do you think they're dangerous?"<br><br>"I'm simply thinking what a complicated war this will be for Coruscant because so many Corellians live here."<br><br>"But we're not at war. Yet."<br><br>"Not as far as governments are concerned," said Jacen. "But feel what's around you."<br><br>Ben's Force senses were a fraction of Jacen's, trained in not much more than physical skills and the beginnings of true meditation. He closed his eyes. He felt the vague tingling at the back of his throat, the hint of something dangerous but far away. The slight breeze across the plaza swept scents of foliage with it. The protest continued, now a little noisier, but still peaceful.<br><br>"I can feel a threat, but it's a long way away." Ben opened his eyes, worried that he had answered the wrong question. "Like a really bad storm coming. Nothing more."<br><br>"Exactly," said Jacen. "Billions of unsettled, unhappy people ready to fight. People who want things to be settled. People who need peace."<br><br>"And that's our job, right?"<br><br>"Yes," said Jacen. "That's our job."<br><br>"And I'll be working with you."<br><br>Ben wanted to make sure. He was learning his first lesson in what Jacen called <i>expedience.</i> Ten days ago he had been a commando, a hero, a real soldier who had helped sabotage Centerpoint Station and enraged the Corellian government. Now he had to be quiet and speak when he was spoken to. He needed to know if Jacen would only treat him as an adult when it suited him, like his father did.<br><br>On some planets, you were a man at thirteen and that was that; no going back, and no worrying about what your parents would say. Mandalorian boys became warriors after trials at thirteen, supervised by their fathers. Jedi were trained from childhood too, but trials took an awful lot longer than that. Ben knew he wouldn't be a Knight until he was well into his twenties.<br><br>It seemed like a lifetime away. Suddenly he envied Mandalorian boys he would probably never meet.<br><br>"Yes," said Jacen at last. "Of course you will. It's not always going to be easy, but you can handle it. I know you can. Some of the things we'll talk about have to be kept between us, but that's the way with military matters. Are you ready for that?"<br><br>As if he would discuss anything with his father. He wasn't even comfortable discussing some things with his mother these days. "Like Admiral Niathal?"<br><br>Jacen s...</p><h2>Creating a Life with God: The Call of Ancient Prayer Practices</h2><p>This book is truly about life with God: a life in which the awareness and consciousness of God sweep us off our feet the way a lover would. It is about taking on the mind of Christ, a process that is a journey, the journey of prayer.&#34;&#34; So begins Wolpert&#39;s invitation to fully experience the lifeline God offers us in prayer. Creating a Life with God goes beyond the rote prayers that so many of us have experienced and found wanting. In fact, Wolpert admits that his own frustration with the formula prayers and his unsettled longing immediately after college led to his search for a different kind of prayer, one that&#39;s &#34;&#34;a deep conversation with God beginning with communion and leading to transformation.&#34;&#34; Prayer illuminates our minds, enabling the love of God to permeate all that we do. The purpose of this book is to nourish a deeper, more satisfying prayer life. Wolpert explains 12 prayer practices and introduces you to historical figures who best illuminate each practice. You&#39;ll discover new ways to pray through * experiencing solititude and silence * using your mind and imagination * using your body and creativity * connecting with nature and community You&#39;ll discover how classical approaches to God can deepen your prayer life today. An appendix offers step-by-step instructions for practicing the Jesus Prayer and the prayer of examen, for walking the labyrinth, and more. Creating a Life with God is suitable for both individual and small group study.</p><p>Daniel Wolpert worked as a research scientist, psychologist, spiritual director, farmer, teacher, and construction worker before earning his Masters of Divinity degree at San Francisco Theological Seminary (SFTS).&nbsp; Over the past nearly thirty years he has taught in the fields of psychology and spiritual formation, led retreats, and delivered talks in such settings as the Art of Spiritual Direction Program at SFTS, the Youth Ministry and Spirituality Project, national ministry conferences, UCLA, UND medical school, Luther Seminary, the 5-Day Academy for Spiritual Formation and numerous churches, camps, and other ministry settings.&nbsp; Recently he has also worked as a church pastor while continuing his spiritual direction work in private practice and through the Penny George Institute for Health and Healing.&nbsp; Daniel is the co-founder and director of the Minnesota Institute of Contemplation and Healing (MICAH, micahprays.org).&nbsp; He is also the author of "Leading a Life with God, the practice of spiritual leadership (Upper Room 2006),&nbsp; "Creating a Life with God: the call of ancient prayer practices"(Upper Room 2003), co-author of "Meeting God in Virtual Reality: using spiritual practices with media" (Abingdon 2004), and most recently "The Collapse of the Three Story Universe: Christianity in an Age of Science" (MICAH 2013).&nbsp;</p><h2>Wet Cement: A Mix of Concrete Poems</h2><p><p>Who says words need to be concrete? This collection shapes poems in surprising and delightful ways.</p><p>Concrete poetry is a perennially popular poetic form because they are fun to look at. But by using the arrangement of the words on the page to convey the meaning of the poem, concrete or shape poems are also easy to write! From the author of the incredibly inventive <i>Lemonade: And Other Poems Squeezed from a Single Word</i> comes another clever collection that shows kids how to look at words and poetry in a whole new way.</p></p><p><b>Bob Raczka</b> has written many books about art and art history for children and several collections of children's poetry including <i>Lemonade: And Other Poems Squeezed from a Single Word</i> and <i>Presidential Misadventures: Poems that Poke Fun at the Man in Charge</i>. He lives in Glen Ellyn, Illinois.Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;At the start of this collection, Raczka notes that he likes to think of poems as "word paintings," and he demonstrates this philosophy to marvelous effect. In each of his 21 concrete poems, he groups the words in a shape that complements or emphasizes the meaning or central concept. Raczka goes even further, playfully arranging the letters in the one-word titles of his poems as well. Even the table of contents is constructed to resemble a table. The result is a fun and clever collection that is sure to inspire young poets. While short, the poems are by turns amusing and thoughtful and make excellent use of figurative language devices. A selection about the Big Dipper includes a metaphor that describes the constellation as "a vessel of stars, my brim overflowing with night." Another offering depicts a thunderstorm as "a cloud tantrum." A few layouts may test some readers, such as one about a home run in which one whole line is printed backward, but most students will enjoy the challenge.

And it's there that she discovers just how rich all the boys are and how different the rich are from you and me...And meanwhile, the eccentric but good-hearted rich boys are shocked to find out how life is on the other side...</p><p>Bisco Hatori made her manga debut with Isshun kan no Romance (A Moment of Romance) in LaLa DX magazine. The comedy Ouran High School Host Club is her breakout hit. When she&#39;s stuck thinking up characters&#39; names, she gets inspired by loud, upbeat music (her radio is set to NACK5 FM). She enjoys reading all kinds of manga, but she&#39;s especially fond of the sci-fi drama Please Save My Earth and Slam Dunk, a basketball classic.</p><h2>Katie and the Sunflowers</h2><p>Join Katie as she steps into some of the most famous paintings in the world for an exciting art adventure! Katie would love to grow her own flowers, so when she sees some seeds in Van Gogh&#39;s Sunflowers masterpiece she can&#39;t resist reaching in and grabbing some ...Mimi, a little girl from a painting nearby, comes to help, but when Mimi&#39;s dog Zazou comes too disaster follows! &#39;A wonderful way to engage children with art. A brilliant combination of education and storytelling&#39; - Parents in Touch (Katie&#39;s Picture Show) This art adventure features five famous post-impressionist paintings: Sunflowers and Cafe Terrace at Night by Vincent van Gogh, Breton Girls Dancing and Tahitian Pastorals by Paul Gauguin and Still Life, with Apples and Oranges by Paul Cezanne. Classic picture book character, Katie, has been delighting children for over 25 years. Why not collect all 13 titles in the series? Katie&#39;s Picture Show Katie and the Impressionists Katie and the Mona Lisa Katie and the British Artists Katie and the Waterlily Pond Katie and the Starry Night Katie and the Spanish Princess Katie and the Bathers Katie in London Katie&#39;s London Christmas Katie in Scotland Katie and the Dinosaurs</p><p>James Mayhew studied at Maidstone College of Art and his first children&#39;s book, Katie&#39;s Picture Show was published in 1989. It&#39;s been firmly in print ever since, recognised universally as the original and best introduction to art for children. Many more titles have followed, and the series sells in museums and galleries all over the world, from the Met in New York, to the Uffizi in Florence, the Louvre in Paris and beyond. He is also the creator of the much-loved Ella Bella Ballerina series, and many other titles. Alongside his work in publishing, James has devised and performed in a hugely successful series of concerts for children, combining live classical music, storytelling and live art. From Peter and the Wolf, to Scheherazade, James has worked internationally with many different orchestras and musicians, creating illustrations in time to music. James grew up in Suffolk but now lives in Hertfordshire.Kindergarten-Grade 3-In this, the third story about Katie's art adventures, the girl and her grandmother leave their garden on a rainy day to go to the museum. The child is drawn to Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers, and discovers she can reach in and touch them. Alas, she bumps the vase and the whole arrangement falls out of the painting and onto the floor. She hears laughter coming from Paul Gauguin's Breton Girls Dancing hanging nearby, and she enters that canvas and enlists the help of one of the girls. Further pandemonium ensues, involving interaction with more paintings, including Paul C?zanne's Still Life with Apples and Oranges. These featured artists, readers are informed on the last page, are the Postimpressionists, known for their use of strong color and line to express feeling. Mayhew's wonderful watercolor illustrations capture the strength of the paintings and, as their contents and people spill out into Katie's world, they change just enough to look as though they could belong there. While the idea of showcasing the paintings is the primary focus and the story secondary, this book succeeds as a lively and imaginative introduction to fine-art appreciation.<br><i>Carolyn Jenks, First Parish Unitarian Church, Portland, ME </i><br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Model 1911 and Model 1911A1 Military and Commercial Pistols (For Collectors Only)</h2><p>The Model 1911 and Model 1911A1 Military and Commercial Pistols, 3rd Edition, totals 566 pages.

Everyone loves Summer Ryan. A model student and musical prodigy, she&#39;s a ray of light in the struggling small town of Grace, Alabama - especially compared to her troubled sister, Raine. Then Summer vanishes. Raine throws herself into the investigation, aided by a most unlikely ally, but the closer she gets to the truth, the more dangerous her search becomes. And perhaps there was always more to Summer than met the eye . . . &#39;A very real, very rare talent&#39; SARAH HILARY &#39;Wonderful&#39; M. R.

It was a Guardian crime book of the month as well as featuring in Crime Time&#39;s top 100 books of 2016 and BuzzFeed&#39;s incredible summer reads. It won the CWA John Creasey New Blood Dagger Award, and was shortlisted for the CrimeFest Last Laugh Award. Chris lives in Hertfordshire with his wife and two young sons.Chris Whitaker is leading the pack of hungry young crime writers by a long mile. He writes like a dark angel, conjuring characters and places so memorable you&#39;ll ache when it&#39;s over. A very real, very rare talent * Sarah Hilary * A novel you swallow whole because you can&#39;t help yourself, and then go back a second time to savour what you missed. Wonderful * M. R. Carey, author of The Girl with All the Gifts * Riveting read. A psychological thriller that stands out from the mass - stylishly written, with a slick command of language and location, and a great &#39;missing girl&#39; mystery at its core. Great stuff! * Vaseem Khan * This book blew me away. Extraordinarily good. Gripping and heartbreaking * Deborah O&#39;Connor * Phenomenal * Jo Spain * BOOK OF THE MONTH - Chris Whitaker&#39;s stunning debut Tall Oaks featured a quirky mix of poignancy and humour that sticks hard in my memory and his rapid follow-up offers much of the same, but with the comedic elements gently muted: tortured souls, a police officer who can&#39;t disentangle the personal from the professional, missing persons, the oppressive background of small-town America and a merciless journey through every stage of personal grief. Despite the outward similarities, it&#39;s a major achievement. Following the disappearance of her much-loved model sister Summer in the wake of five other church-attending young women from the area similarly gone missing, misfit Raine seeks out the truth and uncovers layers of secrets and everyday evil in her Alabama town. Bleak, involving, a delicately sketched portrait of bigotry and prejudice and human emotions dancing the light fantastic, this renews a tired genre with a dose of heart and empathy which appears to be becoming Whitaker&#39;s forte -- Maxim Jakubowski * Crimetime * All the Wicked Girls is impossibly good. And beautiful. And melancholy, utterly compelling and difficult to describe. I love this book . . . All the Wicked Girls is in my top ten books I&#39;ve read ever let alone this year. And trust me that&#39;s a lot of competition to overcome . . . Chris Whitaker is annoyingly talented. I won&#39;t say highly recommended it seems inadequate. Pure magic on the page * Liz Loves Books * I loved it SO much. Chris is so amazing. He just has this real knack of creating characters that you&#39;re completely engaged with . . . I was hooked by his beautiful prose and by the end I was absolutely ruined by the heartbreaking storyline. If only he could write ten books a year * Lisa Hall * Stunning * Michelle Davies * A remarkable book that made me blub * Mike Thomas * I was savouring each page/chapter and character . . . because each page is a literal work of art. Chris Whitaker has the ability to pick up the reader and transport them into the fictional small town of Grace, swelter in the heat, feel the fear and tension amongst the town folk and connect with the characters . . . A beautifully written story of love, friendship, beliefs, fear, passion and I&#39;m not embarrassed to say I cried at the end * Compulsive Readers * This is a crime novel, a love story of sisters, a family torn apart. The story is told by each of the sisters in turn . . . Once started, it&#39;s a fast read. The characters are skilfully written, so it&#39;s easy to get lost in their lives . . . * Strong Book Reviews * Those missing Manny will warm to wannabe teenage policeman Noah, his sidekick Purv and Summer&#39;s sister Raine, who take the search into their hands with black humour and laugh out loud moments as well as real poignancy. There is a great bond which develops between these three damaged outsiders. I marvel at how authentic this British author&#39;s creation of small town America feels, in terms of speech, the environment, their cultural references and lives. The prejudices and obsessions of a small community are so effectively conveyed. It&#39;s a great read. Tall Oaks showed the potential but this is the Real Deal . . . * New Books Magazine * Incredibly intelligently plotted and amazingly descriptive and atmospheric. These characters will stay with you for a long time as the author really brings them to life. It&#39;s all incredibly realistic and believable as the town residents try to cope with the challenges life throws at them, with topics ranging from child abuse to drug addiction to dealing with the loss of a child. And yet somehow, the author manages to occasionally lighten the mood with brilliantly witty one-liners * Novel Delights * The next Gone Girl . . . an emotional read: I felt fully immersed in their lives * Look Magazine * On finishing All The Wicked Girls, I was left with that same sense of being part of something very, very unique . . . There is a very distinct style to Chris Whitaker&#39;s writing . . . All The Wicked Girls is a novel that you will become one with. The characters&#39; emotions will become your emotions; Tragedy, grief, sorrow, regret, yet also, hope, self-discovery and atonement . . . A brooding, intense, incredible read! * Swirl and Thread * First things first, this novel is extremely dark, gritty and chilling. That&#39;s dark with a capital D by the way. If you thought you&#39;ve read something dark before, think again . . . All the Wicked Girls is also highly addictive. I was really surprised by just how much it gripped me from start to finish. All I can say is that Chris Whitaker is an incredibly talented writer, I don&#39;t know how he traps you but it&#39;s some sort of magic * The Bookbag * Chris Whitaker writes superbly. As with Tall Oaks, I marvel at how this British author captures the mood and sound of an American small town . . . Just thinking about Noah, his courage, wisdom, kindness and deep heart, makes me want to weep. This is a novel that takes us into some very dark places. The melancholy of Grace goes far deeper than the storm that hovers over it. It is disturbing at times, there is no doubt of that, but it is also filled with a humanity despite its subject and I was held spellbound. There are so many reasons to read All the Wicked Girls but if I had to give you just one - well, two reasons - it would be to read it for Noah and Purv. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever forget them * For Winter Nights * A riveting, fast-paced story and I rushed through it in order to find out what happened, finishing it in a single day. And whilst I had several theories as to how it would end, none of them were correct, something which pleased me greatly. This is another fantastic novel from Whitaker, and I can&#39;t wait to see what he does next * Jo&#39;s Book Blog * If you like your crime novels bleak and raw with a side of small town strife, this might be for you . . . I strongly feel that anyone who&#39;s a fan of Stephen King&#39;s Under the Dome will like this as well * Read, Eat, Sleep, Repeat * Tall Oaks was (and indeed is) astonishingly good. All The Wicked Girls is even better, filled with fantastic characters in a small-town America where Raine looks for her missing sister. Just buy it, thank me later * Espresso Coco * I marvel at how authentic the author&#39;s creation of small town America feels, in terms of speech, the environment, their cultural references and lives. The prejudices and obsessions of a small community is so effectively conveyed and I found the whole thing totally involving * Reviews Revues * One of my new favorite authors, I love the writing, mystery, and characters that inhabit the pages of Whitaker&#39;s books. And his mysteries fool me every time. Just fantastic! 5 Stars * It&#39;s Book Talk * Another brilliant book by Chris, All the Wicked Girls is a book I predict will be huge. It&#39;s definitely one of those books that you don&#39;t want to end. The only problem is now that I&#39;ve finished is that I have to wait for Chris&#39;s next book; I can&#39;t wait to see what he does next * Jacob reviews books * Small town America has never been portrayed so brilliantly . . . His writing is intense and his voice is wholly unique. His characterization is flawless . . . He writes thrillers that make you feel all of the feelings . . . He takes intricate plotting to a new level * Novel Gossip * Chris Whitaker creates characters as real as your very own friends, places as real are the town you live in and plots that make you marvel at the sheer genius of the mind behind it all... Chris Whitaker could write just about anything and I&#39;d want to read it. Intricately plotted and beautifully written, All the Wicked Girls is spectacular. I can&#39;t recommend it highly enough. A wonderfully dark, gripping, nuanced novel. I loved it! * Ronnie Turner blog * This new book is exquisitely written, with the darkest of hearts, but so beautiful and human and moving that it has been reducing people - me included - to tears. There is writing here that makes your jaw drop, and fills you with joy, and makes you close your eyes and wish that you had the ability to craft something as achingly gorgeous....It is a study of marginalised folk, of broken dreams, of haunted people just trying to get by. It is uplifting and funny and sad. And it is about friendship and lust and grief and the things we will do for our loved ones, no matter how dark the path it takes us down. But in short, All the Wicked Girls is a very special novel, from a very special writer * Mike Thomas * It&#39;s great writing, capturing the voices of the protagonists perfectly and deftly revealing the central mystery - what actually happened to Summer and the others? - only slowly, keeping the reader hooked throughout. This book is magnificent and I&#39;d strongly recommend it. I&#39;m off now to read Tall Oaks, Whitaker&#39;s first book * Blue Book Balloon * All The Wicked Girls is possibly one of the most incredible novels you will read this year. There is only one word that really sums it up effectively - and that word is powerful. There are some sentences that shock you with expletives and then there are some sentences that shock you with their beauty. This book does not have cliffhangers at the end of its chapters, it has something worse. It has sentences that make your stomach lurch and leave you breathless, blinking back tears as the poignancy, brutal honesty or sadness hits you. I think this novel is ambitious and complex in what it sets out to achieve....writing that is faultless * Bibliomaniac * It&#39;s hard these days to find a novel that is not derivative, but this is one of those rare beasts. Read it, not just for the story, but so that you devour the world Whitaker creates. A cracking novel * Frost Magazine * There are many well-defined characters in this amusing, powerful and compelling novel. The plot is well constructed and the writing zings * Crime Thriller Hound * This is one of those harrowing books that succeeds in making us care deeply about its thoroughly flawed, long-suffering protagonists. When resolution comes, it feels as if we too have been through the peril, the anguish, the storm and the shoot-out. Whether you experience it as a challenging crime drama, a masterful web of character studies or a dark and gritty movie running compellingly in your mind, All The Wicked Girls will have you gasping and wincing to the last page * My Weekly * All The Wicked Girls is a novel that you will become one with. The characters&#39; emotions will become your emotions; Tragedy, grief, sorrow, regret, yet also, hope, self-discovery and atonement. A brooding, intense, incredible read! * Writing.ie * An intelligent and emotionally affecting crime novel which defies easy categorisation * Crime Fiction Lover * This is a novel that fulfils its purpose on every level; the setting, the characters and the story are all uniquely woven to form a masterful piece of work, and one which will live in my memory for a long time... an incandescent novel * The Book Club Cafe * I was gripped from the very beginning... It took turns I wasn&#39;t expecting and I just was so amazed at how brilliant this book was. I was left speechless after reading * The Reader&#39;s Corner * A tale as dark as the storm cloud, with chinks of light provided by the antics of Noah and Purv who, for me, steal the show. A highly original crime thriller * Daily Record * This is a crime story with a difference, a beautifully plotted, genuinely absorbing set of character studies, worked into a wider story of missing girls and religious fervour * Zainab&#39;s Blog * Below the surface of Chris Whitaker&#39;s story there is unexpected depth and richness. This is one of those harrowing books that succeeds in making us care deeply about its thoroughly flawed, long-suffering protagonists. It&#39;s hard to believe this book was written by a former City of London financial trader who lives in Hertfordshire, so complete is the immersion in another, utterly different place. Whether you experience it as a challenging crime drama, a masterful web of character studies or a dark and gritty movie running compellingly in your mind, All The Wicked Girls will have you gasping and wincing to the last page * My Weekly * All The Wicked Girls is a gripping thriller, but also a deeply emotional story with a big heart and characters you&#39;ll cry over. It&#39;s a thriller that explores the worst excesses of organised religion, but also the positives aspects of faith. Highly highly recommended! * Back To The Books * Chris Whitaker burst onto the literary scene last year with his rare and remarkable debut, Tall Oaks, announcing the arrival of a mercurial and exciting talent. From the first page, Whitaker effortlessly draws the reader into the heart of this world and his characters...his characterisation is unfaltering and hugely impressive and for me is the real standout trait of his fiction...Indeed, all of Whitaker&#39;s characters are engaging, flawed and authentic... He has an uncanny ability to pull on the heartstrings that again makes his books special. For me, Whitaker is a master of a style and genre all of his own. An impressive talent and an intuitive and distinctive writer, his first two novels are signs of a new star with a very bright future still to come * Nudge Books * very impressed by Whitaker&#39;s writing and Summer as a character in particular * Debbish.com * Whitaker really does have a talent in creating atmosphere. I felt fully absorbed and immersed in the dark world of Grace and what was happening there. I also really enjoyed the writing and especially Summer&#39;s chapters. * The Books Are Everywhere * At the heart of this story is an intricate mystery that put every single detective skill I think I have to the test and guess what?...I failed miserably. Chris Whitaker completely fooled me (again) and I couldn&#39;t be happier. In the end, this is a story filled with tragedy, heartbreak, redemption, and yes hope and I highly recommend it to everyone who&#39;s a fan of mysteries and memorable characters! So, yes it definitely lived up to my high expectations * It&#39;s Book Talk * All the Wicked Girls is quite slow and incredibly dark but the tension is palpable throughout. It&#39;s incredibly intelligently plotted and amazingly descriptive. These characters will stay with you for a long time as the author really brings them to life. It&#39;s all incredibly realistic and believable as the town residents try to cope with the challenges life throws at them, with topics ranging from child abuse to drug addiction to dealing with the loss of a child. And yet somehow, the author manages to occasionally lighten the mood with brilliantly witty one-liners * Novel Deelights * The setting is fantastically well done * Tamara Morning * It&#39;s certainly a book to immerse yourself in and I was surprised how moved I was by the whole dang thing. With his unique writing style and quirky stories, Chris Whitaker is definitely an author to watch out for * The Book Magnet * Dark, in every sense, evocative and the characters will break your heart * Tammy Cohen * &#39;For me it was what I call a one sit read and for most of it I was completely hooked...Whitaker is an amazing storyteller...It&#39;s totally amazing.&#39; * Tracey Shepherd book blog * &#39;I absolutely adored this book and can only describe it as a ch...</p><h2>Harry, el perrito sucio (Harry the Dirty Dog, Spanish edition)</h2><p><p><em>This high-quality Spanish-language book can be enjoyed by fluent Spanish speakers as well as those learning the language, whether at home or in a classroom.</em></p><p>Harry es un perrito blanco con manchas negras al que todo le gusta... excepto ba�arse.

Michael translates the influences of the diverse working-class neighborhood in which he grew up into dishes with Mediterranean ingredients, such as those in Olive Oil Poached Halibut with Fennel, Rosemary, and Garlic; Italian-style handmade pastas, like Linguini with Heirloom Tomato, Capers, Anchovies, and Chilies; and re-imagined Cleveland favorites, such as Mac and Cheese with Roasted Chicken, Goat Cheese, and Rosemary.<br><br>Part of Michael&#x2019;s irresistible allure on the Food Network comes from how much fun he has in the kitchen.

And in true Golden Age fashion, her oeuvre opens with, yes, a country-house party between the two world wars &#x2013; servants bustling, gin flowing, the gentlemen in dinner jackets, the ladies all slink and smolder. Even more delicious: The host, Sir Hubert Handesley, has invented a new and especially exciting version of that beloved parlor entertainment, The Murder Game. </p></p><p>From her first book in 1934 to her final volume just before her death in 1982, <b>Ngaio Marsh's </b>work has remained legendary, and is often compared to that of Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers. During her celebrated fifty-year career, Marsh was made a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America, was named Dame Commander, Order of the British Empire, won numerous prestigious awards, and penned 32 mystery novels.<br><br>Now St. Martin's Dead Letter Mysteries is thrilled to make all of Marsh's novels available again for old fans to relish and new ones to discover. So sit back, draw the curtains, lock the doors, and put yourself in the hands of the Grand Dame of detective novels...<br>Sir Hubert Handesley regularly invites a small group of friends and acquaintances to Frampton, his country estate. This weekend he has something special planned--a murder game. But then one of the players is discovered with a real dagger in his back. A MAN LAY DEAD introduces us to Inspector Roderick Alleyn, Marsh's intelligent, cool, and inscrutable inspector from Scotland Yard. James Saxon narrates with a wonderful British accent--just a bit upper crust--and perfect pacing to move the story through its startling revelations and subtle suggestions. However, his attempts to create individual voices for each character fall short. His women are fairly distinct, although the servants' voices come across as stereotypes, but his male characters are too similar, leading to some confusion in following the plot.
